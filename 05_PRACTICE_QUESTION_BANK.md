### Answer Key - Chapter 12

**Section A:** 1.(d) arithmetic mean 2.(b) 2 3.(c) C.V. 4.(d) 0 5.(b) quartile 6.(c) y = mx + c 7.(a) greater 8. 4 9. True 10. 10 11. True 12. mean 13. False 14. mutually 15. Q1

**Section B:**
1. Total = 14; 8th item lies in class 21-30; items less than 21 = 7
2. (a) Rs.500 (b) Full time IQR = Rs.300; Part time: varies (c) positive
3. Range = 599, Var = 28886 approx
4. mean = 66.35, Var = 67.57, SD = 8.22
5. mean = 758.8, Var = 19097, SD = 138.19, CV = 18.2
7. 0.85
8. 0.7
9. Q1 = 57.5, Q2 = 77.5, Q3 = 92.5, IQR = 35
10. (i) 5/10 = 1/2 (ii) 8/10 = 4/5
11. 0.63
12. 0.72

**Section C:**
1. OPD has more variation (higher CV of 13.46 vs 11.24). OPD patient BP data is more dispersed.
2. Range = Rs.150,000 - Rs.25,000 = Rs.125,000; IQR = Rs.90,000 - Rs.50,000 = Rs.40,000
3. variance = 83.14, SD = 9.12
4. IQR1 = 30, IQR2 = 10; negative correlation; more exercise time reduces BP
5. (i) P(AuB) = 0.4 + 0.5 - 0.2 = 0.7 (ii) P(A|B) = 0.2/0.5 = 0.4 (iii) P(A)*P(B) = 0.2 = P(AnB), so yes, they are independent
6. P(both lemon) = (3/5) * (2/4) = 6/20 = 3/10
7. P(defective) = 0.6 * 0.2 + 0.4 * 0.15 = 0.12 + 0.06 = 0.18
8. Q1 = 27, Q2 = 33.5, Q3 = 41.25; IQR = 14.25; Lower fence = 27 - 1.5*14.25 = 5.625; Upper fence = 41.25 + 1.5*14.25 = 62.625; No outliers (all values within fences)

## APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE FORMULAS

### Complex Numbers
- i^2 = -1, i^3 = -i, i^4 = 1 (cycle repeats)
- |z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) for z = a + bi
- z * z_bar = |z|^2

### Quadratic Equations
- Quadratic Formula: x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
- Discriminant: D = b^2 - 4ac
- Sum of roots = -b/a, Product of roots = c/a
- Formation: x^2 - Sx + P = 0

### Matrices
- |A| = ad - bc for A = [a b; c d]
- A^(-1) = (1/|A|) * adj(A)

### Trigonometry
- Law of Cosines: a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cosA
- Law of Sines: a/sinA = b/sinB = c/sinC
- Area = (1/2)ab*sinC
- R = a/(2sinA) [circumradius]

### Circle Theorems
- Angle at centre = 2 * angle at circumference
- Angle in semicircle = 90 degrees
- Opposite angles of cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees
- Tangent perpendicular to radius at point of contact

### Statistics
- Variance = sum of (xi - mean)^2 / n
- SD = sqrt(Variance)
- CV = (SD / mean) * 100
- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
- P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) [if independent]
