---

## Revision Strategy for the Last 2 Weeks Before Exams

If your exam is approaching and you have 2 weeks left, here is how to use that time:

### Week A (14-8 days before exam): Active Recall

1. **Day 1-2**: Review Chapters 1-3 (Complex Numbers, Quadratic Equations, Matrices). Redo 3-4 problems per exercise without looking at solutions first.
2. **Day 3-4**: Review Chapters 4-6 (Inequalities, Algebraic Fractions, Functions & Graphs). Focus on tricky problem types you got wrong before.
3. **Day 5**: Review Chapter 7-8 (Vectors, Trigonometry). Memorize key formulae: law of sines, cosines, tangents, half-angle formulae, area formulae.
4. **Day 6**: Review Chapters 9-11 (Circle Geometry). Practice at least 2 proofs from each chapter. Do 2 full constructions from Chapter 11.
5. **Day 7**: Review Chapter 12 (Statistics & Probability). Work through variance/SD calculations and at least 3 probability problems.

### Week B (7-1 days before exam): Sharpen and Polish

1. **Day 1-2**: Do 2 full Miscellaneous Exercises (end-of-chapter) under timed conditions (45 min each).
2. **Day 3**: Review all MCQs from every chapter's miscellaneous exercise. These test conceptual understanding.
3. **Day 4**: Create (or review) your formula sheet. Write every formula from memory, then check against the textbook.
4. **Day 5**: Do one more timed practice paper. Identify remaining weak spots.
5. **Day 6**: Light review only -- go through your formula sheet, read your notes on common mistakes. Do NOT start any new topic.
6. **Day 7 (day before exam)**: Relax. Quick glance at formulae. Sleep well. Trust your preparation.

## Time Management Tips

1. **Use the Pomodoro Technique**: Study for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. After 4 rounds, take a longer 15-minute break. This keeps your brain fresh.

2. **Start with what is hard, end with what is easy**: If you find trigonometry challenging, tackle it first when your mind is sharpest. Save easier review for later.

3. **Practice beats reading**: Math is a doing subject. For every 10 minutes you read, spend 30 minutes solving problems. The ratio should be roughly 1:3.

4. **Keep a mistake journal**: Every time you get a problem wrong, write down:
   - What the problem was
   - What you did wrong
   - What the correct approach is
   - Review this journal weekly

5. **Do not skip exercises**: Your textbook exercises are your best resource. Attempting every problem (even if you need hints) is better than skipping.

6. **Use weekends wisely**: Weekends are for catch-up, practice tests, and reviewing the week's work. Do not leave them empty.

7. **Study with a friend**: Explain concepts to each other. If you can teach something, you truly understand it.

# PART 2: CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER GUIDE

---

## Chapter 1: Complex Numbers (Pages 6-26)

### What You Will Learn
You will enter a completely new number system! Until now, you could not take the square root of a negative number. In this chapter, you will discover imaginary numbers (using the special number i where i squared = -1), learn to add, subtract, multiply, and divide complex numbers, explore their cool properties, plot them on a special plane, and even solve real-world problems from electrical engineering.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- You should be comfortable with basic algebra (expanding brackets, simplifying expressions)
- You need to know how to work with surds (square roots like sqrt(2), sqrt(5))
- Know the identity (a+b)(a-b) = a squared - b squared -- it is essential for division
- Be familiar with the Cartesian coordinate plane (x-axis, y-axis, plotting points)

### Key Points to Remember
1. **The imaginary unit**: i = sqrt(-1), and i squared = -1. This is the foundation of everything in this chapter.
2. **Powers of i cycle in a pattern**: i, -1, -i, 1, i, -1, -i, 1, ... (repeats every 4). So for any power of i, divide the exponent by 4 and use the remainder.
3. **Complex number form**: a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
4. **Conjugate**: The conjugate of a + bi is a - bi. You flip the sign of the imaginary part.
5. **Division trick**: Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. This eliminates i from the denominator.
6. **Modulus**: |z| = sqrt(a squared + b squared). It measures the distance from the origin in the complex plane.
7. **Key property**: z times z-bar = |z| squared. This always gives a real number.

### Step-by-Step Method
**To simplify complex number expressions:**
1. Replace sqrt(-n) with i times sqrt(n) for any positive n.
2. Apply normal algebra rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication.
3. Whenever you see i squared, replace it with -1.
4. Collect real parts together and imaginary parts together.
5. Write the final answer in the form a + bi.

**To divide complex numbers (z1 / z2):**
1. Write both numbers in a + bi form.
2. Find the conjugate of the denominator.
3. Multiply both numerator and denominator by that conjugate.
4. Expand and simplify (replace i squared with -1).
5. Separate into real and imaginary parts.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Common mistake**: Writing sqrt(-2) times sqrt(-5) = sqrt(10). This is WRONG! You must convert to i form first: (i times sqrt(2)) times (i times sqrt(5)) = i squared times sqrt(10) = -sqrt(10).
- **Powers of i**: Students often panic at i to the power 47. Just divide 47 by 4: 47 = 4 times 11 + 3, so i to the 47 = i to the 3 = -i.
- **Forgetting the conjugate trick**: If you are stuck dividing, always multiply top and bottom by the conjugate.
- **Systems of equations with complex coefficients**: Treat them like normal simultaneous equations. Use substitution or elimination. The arithmetic is just a bit more involved.

### Quick Self-Test
1. Simplify: (3 + 2i)(4 - 5i)
   > **Answer**: 12 - 15i + 8i - 10(i squared) = 12 - 7i + 10 = **22 - 7i**

2. Find the multiplicative inverse of 2 + 3i.
   > **Answer**: 1/(2+3i) = (2-3i)/((2+3i)(2-3i)) = (2-3i)/(4+9) = **(2-3i)/13 = 2/13 - 3i/13**

3. What is i to the power 100?
   > **Answer**: 100 / 4 = 25 remainder 0, so i to the 100 = (i to the 4) to the 25 = 1 to the 25 = **1**

4. Find |z| if z = 5 - 12i.
   > **Answer**: |z| = sqrt(25 + 144) = sqrt(169) = **13**

### Pro Tips
- Draw the Argand diagram (complex plane) whenever you can. Visualizing complex numbers as points helps a lot.
- When the problem says "separate into real and imaginary parts," always aim for the form a + bi at the end.
- In electrical engineering problems, they use j instead of i (because i is used for current). If you see j in a problem, treat it exactly like i.

## Chapter 2: Quadratic Equations (Pages 27-54)

### What You Will Learn
This is one of the most important chapters in your entire textbook. You will learn to solve quadratic equations using four different methods, discover what the discriminant tells you about roots before you even solve the equation, learn the elegant relationships between roots and coefficients, and tackle real-world word problems. You will also handle equations that are not quadratic but can be cleverly converted into quadratic form.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Factorization of quadratic expressions (from 9th grade)
- Completing the square technique
- Knowledge of the number line and coordinate plane
- Understanding of what "roots" or "solutions" of an equation mean

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Standard form**: ax squared + bx + c = 0, where a is not 0.
2. **Four solving methods**: (i) Graphing, (ii) Factorization, (iii) Completing the square, (iv) Quadratic formula.
3. **Quadratic formula**: x = (-b plus or minus sqrt(b squared - 4ac)) / 2a.
4. **Discriminant** (D = b squared - 4ac):
   - D > 0 and a perfect square: roots are real, rational, unequal
   - D = 0: roots are real, rational, equal (repeated root)
   - D > 0 but not a perfect square: roots are real, irrational, unequal
   - D < 0: roots are imaginary/complex
5. **Sum of roots**: S = -b/a. **Product of roots**: P = c/a.
6. **Formation formula**: If roots are S1 and S2, the equation is x squared - Sx + P = 0.
7. **Reducible equations**: Degree-4 equations (substitute x squared = y), reciprocal equations (substitute y = x + 1/x), exponential equations (substitute k to the x = y).

### Step-by-Step Method
**Solving by Quadratic Formula (the universal method):**
1. Write the equation in standard form ax squared + bx + c = 0.
2. Identify a, b, and c.
3. Calculate the discriminant: D = b squared - 4ac.
4. Plug into the formula: x = (-b plus or minus sqrt(D)) / 2a.
5. Simplify and write the solution set.

**Solving Equations Reducible to Quadratic Form:**
1. Look for a pattern (e.g., x to the 4 can become y squared if y = x squared).
2. Make the substitution and solve the resulting quadratic.
3. Back-substitute to find the original variable.
4. Check all solutions in the original equation (some may be extraneous).

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Completing the square when a is not 1**: First divide the entire equation by a, then complete the square on the x terms. Do not forget to add the same quantity to BOTH sides.
- **Reciprocal equations**: The key is to divide by x squared first, then group terms cleverly as (x squared + 1/x squared) and (x + 1/x). Remember: if y = x + 1/x, then x squared + 1/x squared = y squared - 2.
- **Exponential equations**: Remember that k to the x can never be negative. So if you get 3 to the x = -1, that has no real solution.
- **Word problems**: Read the problem twice. Define your variable clearly. Set up the equation. Solve. Then CHECK that your answer makes sense in context (negative lengths, negative ages, etc. should be rejected).

### Quick Self-Test
1. Solve: x squared - 5x + 6 = 0 by factorization.
   > **Answer**: (x-2)(x-3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3. **S.S. = {2, 3}**

2. Find the nature of roots of 2x squared + 3x + 5 = 0.
   > **Answer**: D = 9 - 40 = -31 < 0. **Roots are imaginary.**

3. If roots of a quadratic equation are 3 and -2, form the equation.
   > **Answer**: S = 3 + (-2) = 1, P = 3 times (-2) = -6. Equation: **x squared - x - 6 = 0**

4. Solve: 4 to the x - 6 times 2 to the x + 8 = 0.
   > **Answer**: Let 2 to the x = y. Then y squared - 6y + 8 = 0, so (y-2)(y-4) = 0, y = 2 or y = 4. Back-substitute: 2 to the x = 2 gives x = 1; 2 to the x = 4 gives x = 2. **S.S. = {1, 2}**

### Pro Tips
- The quadratic formula ALWAYS works. If you are stuck on factorization, go straight to the formula.
- For MCQs asking about the nature of roots, just calculate the discriminant. You do not need to find the actual roots.
- Always verify your solution by plugging it back into the original equation.
- In simultaneous equations (one linear, one quadratic), always express one variable from the linear equation and substitute into the quadratic.

## Chapter 3: Matrices and Determinants (Pages 55-77)

### What You Will Learn
Matrices are like organized containers for numbers arranged in rows and columns. You will learn how to classify matrices by type, perform operations on them (add, subtract, multiply), calculate determinants and inverses of 2x2 matrices, and use two powerful methods -- Matrix Inversion and Cramer's Rule -- to solve systems of linear equations. This topic is heavily used in computer science, engineering, and economics.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Comfort with arithmetic operations (especially fractions)
- Understanding of simultaneous linear equations from earlier classes
- Knowledge of what "inverse" means (multiplicative inverse: a number times its inverse = 1)

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Order of a matrix**: m-by-n (m rows, n columns). Two matrices can be added/subtracted only if they have the same order.
2. **Matrix multiplication rule**: A(m-by-n) times B(n-by-p) = AB(m-by-p). The number of columns of A must equal the number of rows of B.
3. **Commutative property does NOT hold for multiplication**: AB is not equal to BA in general.
4. **Determinant of a 2x2 matrix** [[a,b],[c,d]]: |A| = ad - bc.
5. **Singular matrix**: |A| = 0 (no inverse exists). **Non-singular**: |A| is not 0 (inverse exists).
6. **Adjoint of 2x2 matrix**: Swap the primary diagonal elements and change signs of secondary diagonal elements.
7. **Inverse formula**: A inverse = (1/|A|) times adj(A).

### Step-by-Step Method
**Solving equations using Matrix Inversion Method:**
1. Write the system in matrix form: AX = B.
2. Calculate |A|. If |A| = 0, the system has no unique solution.
3. Find adj(A).
4. Calculate A inverse = (1/|A|) times adj(A).
5. X = A inverse times B. Read off the values of x and y.

**Solving using Cramer's Rule:**
1. Write the system in matrix form: AX = B.
2. Calculate D = |A|.
3. Calculate Dx (replace the first column of A with B) and Dy (replace the second column of A with B).
4. x = Dx / D, y = Dy / D.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative**: AB and BA are usually different (and one might not even be possible when the other is).
- **Students confuse order**: Always check: "Can I multiply these?" by comparing columns of the first matrix with rows of the second.
- **Sign errors in determinants**: Write ad - bc carefully. Many students write ad + bc by accident.
- **Cramer's Rule column replacement**: When finding Dx, replace the FIRST column (x-coefficients) with B. When finding Dy, replace the SECOND column (y-coefficients) with B. Do not mix them up.
- **Singular matrices**: If |A| = 0, state clearly that the inverse does not exist and the system cannot be solved by this method.

### Quick Self-Test
1. If A = [[3,1],[5,2]], find |A|.
   > **Answer**: |A| = 3(2) - 1(5) = 6 - 5 = **1**

2. Find the inverse of A = [[3,1],[5,2]].
   > **Answer**: adj(A) = [[2,-1],[-5,3]]. A inverse = (1/1) times [[2,-1],[-5,3]] = **[[2,-1],[-5,3]]**

3. Solve using Cramer's Rule: x + 2y = 5, 3x + 4y = 11.
   > **Answer**: D = 4-6 = -2. Dx = 20-22 = -2. Dy = 11-15 = -4. x = -2/-2 = 1. y = -4/-2 = 2. **Solution: (1, 2)**

### Pro Tips
- Always check your answer: If you solved AX = B and got X, multiply A times X and see if you get B.
- When verifying A inverse, check that A times A inverse = I (identity matrix).
- For word problems, define variables, set up two equations, then choose either method.
- Diagonal, scalar, and identity matrices are special cases. Know them for MCQs.

## Chapter 4: Linear and Quadratic Inequalities (Pages 78-96)

### What You Will Learn
Inequalities are like equations but instead of "equals," you work with "less than," "greater than," "less than or equal to," and "greater than or equal to." You will learn to solve linear inequalities in one variable, quadratic inequalities, absolute value equations and inequalities, and systems of linear inequalities with graphical representation.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Solving linear and quadratic equations
- Number line concepts
- Understanding of the coordinate plane
- Absolute value concept: |x| means the distance of x from 0

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Inequality direction flips** when you multiply or divide both sides by a NEGATIVE number.
2. **Open circle** on the number line for < or > (boundary NOT included). **Closed circle** for <= or >= (boundary included).
3. **Quadratic inequality method**: Solve the related equation first, then test intervals on the number line.
4. **Absolute value**: |x| = a means x = a or x = -a. |x| < a means -a < x < a. |x| > a means x < -a or x > a.
5. **Graphing systems of linear inequalities**: Graph each inequality as a half-plane. The solution is the intersection (overlap) region.

### Step-by-Step Method
**Solving a quadratic inequality (e.g., x squared - 5x + 6 > 0):**
1. Solve x squared - 5x + 6 = 0 to get x = 2 and x = 3.
2. These divide the number line into 3 intervals: (-infinity, 2), (2, 3), (3, infinity).
3. Pick a test point from each interval and check if the inequality holds.
4. Write the solution set based on which intervals satisfy the inequality.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **THE flip rule**: The number one mistake is forgetting to reverse the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative. For example, -3x > 6 becomes x < -2 (NOT x > -2).
- **Absolute value inequalities**: Remember the two cases. |x - 3| < 5 becomes -5 < x - 3 < 5, which gives -2 < x < 8.
- **Graphing**: Use a dashed line for strict inequalities (< or >) and a solid line for non-strict inequalities (<= or >=).

### Quick Self-Test
1. Solve: 3x - 7 > 5
   > **Answer**: 3x > 12, x > 4. **S.S. = {x | x > 4}**

2. Solve: |2x - 1| = 5
   > **Answer**: 2x - 1 = 5 or 2x - 1 = -5. So x = 3 or x = -2. **S.S. = {-2, 3}**

3. Solve: x squared - 4 <= 0
   > **Answer**: (x-2)(x+2) <= 0. Testing intervals: **-2 <= x <= 2**

### Pro Tips
- When solving compound inequalities, solve each part separately and then combine.
- For graphing two-variable inequalities, always shade the correct region by testing a point (usually the origin) in the original inequality.
- Double-check: does your solution make sense when you plug it back in?

## Chapter 5: Algebraic Fractions (Pages 97-114)

### What You Will Learn
This chapter deals with fractions where the numerator and denominator are algebraic expressions (polynomials). You will classify expressions, simplify algebraic fractions by factoring, and perform all four operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). You will also solve equations involving algebraic fractions and apply them to word problems.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Strong factorization skills (HCF, LCM of expressions, difference of squares, perfect square trinomials)
- Operations with numerical fractions
- Basic polynomial concepts from 9th grade

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Rational expression**: A fraction p(x)/q(x) where both p(x) and q(x) are polynomials and q(x) is not 0.
2. **Simplification**: Factor numerator and denominator, then cancel common factors.
3. **Addition/Subtraction**: Find LCM of denominators (just like adding fractions with numbers).
4. **Multiplication**: Multiply numerators together and denominators together. Simplify by canceling common factors first (this saves work).
5. **Division**: Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor.
6. **Solving rational equations**: Multiply both sides by the LCM of all denominators to clear fractions, then solve the resulting equation. Always check for extraneous solutions (values that make a denominator zero).

### Step-by-Step Method
**To add/subtract algebraic fractions:**
1. Factor all denominators.
2. Find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of all denominators.
3. Rewrite each fraction with the LCM as denominator.
4. Add or subtract the numerators.
5. Simplify the result by factoring if possible.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Extraneous solutions**: When you solve a rational equation by clearing denominators, you might introduce solutions that make the original denominator zero. Always check!
- **Sign errors when subtracting fractions**: When subtracting, make sure to distribute the negative sign to ALL terms in the second numerator.
- **Factorization is crucial**: If your factorization is wrong, everything that follows will be wrong. Take your time with this step.

### Quick Self-Test
1. Simplify: (x squared - 9) / (x + 3)
   > **Answer**: (x+3)(x-3)/(x+3) = **x - 3** (where x is not -3)

2. Add: 1/(x+1) + 1/(x-1)
   > **Answer**: ((x-1) + (x+1)) / ((x+1)(x-1)) = 2x / (x squared - 1) = **2x/(x squared - 1)**

3. Solve: 3/(x-2) = 5/(x+1)
   > **Answer**: 3(x+1) = 5(x-2), 3x+3 = 5x-10, 13 = 2x, x = 13/2 = **6.5**

### Pro Tips
- Factor first, calculate later. This is the golden rule for algebraic fractions.
- Watch your domain restrictions: any value of x that makes a denominator zero is excluded from the domain.
- For complex fractions (fractions within fractions), multiply the main numerator and denominator by the LCM of all the inner denominators.

## Chapter 6: Functions and Graphs (Pages 115-139)

### What You Will Learn
Functions are at the heart of mathematics. You will learn what makes a relation a function, explore different types of functions (into, onto, one-to-one, bijective), perform operations on functions including composition, find inverse functions, and graph many types of functions. You will also learn to find the gradient (slope) of a curve at a point and solve systems of equations graphically.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Set theory basics (sets, subsets, elements)
- Cartesian coordinate system and plotting points
- Concept of ordered pairs
- Solving linear and quadratic equations

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Function**: A relation where each input (x-value) maps to exactly ONE output (y-value). No x-value repeats with different y-values.
2. **Domain**: Set of all possible inputs. **Range**: Set of all outputs. **Co-domain**: The set the function maps into.
3. **Types of functions**:
   - Into function: Range is a proper subset of co-domain (some elements in co-domain have no pre-image)
   - Onto (surjective): Range = co-domain (every element in co-domain has at least one pre-image)
   - One-to-one (injective): Different inputs always give different outputs
   - Bijective: Both one-to-one AND onto
4. **Composition**: (fog)(x) = f(g(x)). Apply the inner function first, then the outer.
5. **Inverse function**: If f(x) = y, then f inverse(y) = x. To find it: write y = f(x), swap x and y, solve for y.
6. **Vertical line test**: If any vertical line crosses the graph at more than one point, it is NOT a function.

### Step-by-Step Method
**Finding the inverse of a function:**
1. Write y = f(x).
2. Swap x and y (replace every y with x and every x with y).
3. Solve the new equation for y.
4. The result is f inverse(x).
5. Verify: f(f inverse(x)) = x.

**Finding gradient of a curve at a point:**
1. Draw the tangent line to the curve at the given point.
2. Take two points on the tangent line.
3. Gradient = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Composition order matters**: f(g(x)) is NOT the same as g(f(x)) in general. Always apply the inner function first.
- **Not every function has an inverse**: Only one-to-one functions have inverses. If f(2) = 5 and f(3) = 5, then f is not one-to-one, and its inverse does not exist as a function.
- **Graphing reciprocal functions**: y = 1/x has two branches (in the first and third quadrants). It never touches the axes (asymptotes).
- **Exponential graphs**: y = a to the x always passes through (0, 1) and never touches the x-axis.

### Quick Self-Test
1. If f(x) = 2x + 3, find f(5).
   > **Answer**: f(5) = 2(5) + 3 = **13**

2. If f(x) = 3x - 1 and g(x) = x squared, find f(g(2)).
   > **Answer**: g(2) = 4, f(4) = 3(4) - 1 = **11**

3. Find the inverse of f(x) = (2x + 1)/3.
   > **Answer**: y = (2x+1)/3. Swap: x = (2y+1)/3. Solve: 3x = 2y+1, y = (3x-1)/2. **f inverse(x) = (3x-1)/2**

4. Is f = {(1,a), (2,b), (3,a)} a function? Is it one-to-one?
   > **Answer**: Yes, it is a function (no x-value repeats). No, it is NOT one-to-one (both 1 and 3 map to 'a').

### Pro Tips
- When graphing, always plot at least 5 points. More points = better curve.
- For solving a linear and quadratic equation graphically, the intersection points of the two graphs are your solutions.
- Remember that the graph of the inverse function is the reflection of the original graph across the line y = x.

## Chapter 7: Vectors in Plane (Pages 140-159)

### What You Will Learn
Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude (size) and direction -- like force, velocity, and displacement. You will learn how to represent vectors geometrically and algebraically, perform vector operations (addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication), find magnitudes, resolve vectors into rectangular components, and apply vectors to solve geometry problems.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Coordinate geometry basics (distance formula, midpoint)
- Pythagorean theorem
- Basic trigonometry (sin, cos, tan for right triangles)
- Understanding of translation and geometric shapes

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Vector notation**: A vector from A to B is written as AB (with arrow on top) or as a bold letter a. Its magnitude is |AB| or |a|.
2. **Position vector**: The vector from the origin O to a point P. If P = (x, y), then OP = xi + yj.
3. **Magnitude**: If v = (a, b), then |v| = sqrt(a squared + b squared).
4. **Unit vector**: A vector with magnitude 1. Unit vector of v = v / |v|.
5. **Vector addition**: (a1, b1) + (a2, b2) = (a1+a2, b1+b2). Geometrically: head-to-tail method or parallelogram law.
6. **Scalar multiplication**: k(a, b) = (ka, kb). If k > 0, same direction. If k < 0, opposite direction.
7. **Key result**: If a and b are position vectors of A and B, then AB = b - a.

### Step-by-Step Method
**Finding the magnitude and direction of a resultant vector:**
1. Write both vectors in component form (xi + yj).
2. Add corresponding components: resultant = (x1+x2)i + (y1+y2)j.
3. Magnitude = sqrt((x1+x2) squared + (y1+y2) squared).

**Using vectors to prove geometric results:**
1. Express the sides or diagonals of the shape in terms of position vectors.
2. Use vector properties (parallel vectors are scalar multiples, equal vectors have same components).
3. Draw conclusions about the geometric shape.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Direction matters**: AB and BA are NOT the same. AB = -BA.
- **Parallel vectors**: Two vectors are parallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. If a = kb for some scalar k, then a is parallel to b.
- **Rectangular components**: A vector can be resolved as v = |v|cos(theta) i + |v|sin(theta) j, where theta is the angle with the positive x-axis.
- **Translation**: A translation by vector v moves every point P to P' where PP' = v. The shape and size do not change.

### Quick Self-Test
1. If A = (2, 3) and B = (5, 7), find vector AB.
   > **Answer**: AB = (5-2, 7-3) = **(3, 4)**

2. Find the magnitude of vector v = (3, 4).
   > **Answer**: |v| = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = **5**

3. If u = (1, 2) and v = (3, -1), find u + v and u - v.
   > **Answer**: u + v = **(4, 1)**, u - v = **(-2, 3)**

### Pro Tips
- Always draw a diagram when working with vectors. It helps you visualize the problem.
- For geometry proofs using vectors, express everything in terms of a few base vectors and manipulate algebraically.
- Remember: vectors have no fixed position. A vector only has magnitude and direction. You can translate it anywhere on the plane.

## Chapter 8: Application of Trigonometry (Pages 160-195)

### What You Will Learn
This is the longest and most formula-heavy chapter. You will extend trigonometric ratios beyond 90 degrees (up to 180 degrees), solve right triangles and oblique triangles using the laws of sines, cosines, and tangents, learn half-angle formulae, calculate areas of triangles in multiple ways, work with circumcircles, incircles, and escribed circles, and even tackle 3D trigonometry problems.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- All six trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec, cot) and their values for standard angles (0, 30, 45, 60, 90 degrees)
- Pythagorean theorem
- Basic triangle properties (angle sum = 180 degrees)
- Algebra skills for manipulating formulae

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Extending ratios**: For angles 90 to 180 degrees, sin is positive, cos and tan are negative (second quadrant).
2. **Law of Cosines**: a squared = b squared + c squared - 2bc cos(A). Use this when you know SAS or SSS.
3. **Law of Sines**: a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). Use this when you know AAS or ASA.
4. **Law of Tangents**: (a-b)/(a+b) = tan((A-B)/2) / tan((A+B)/2).
5. **Half-angle formulae**: Express sin(A/2), cos(A/2), tan(A/2) in terms of the sides a, b, c using the semi-perimeter s.
6. **Area formulae**:
   - SAS: Area = (1/2)ab sin(C)
   - AAS: Area = a squared sin(B) sin(C) / (2 sin(A))
   - SSS (Heron's): Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) where s = (a+b+c)/2
7. **Circumradius**: R = a/(2sin(A)). **Inradius**: r = Area/s. **Escribed circle radius**: r1 = Area/(s-a).

### Step-by-Step Method
**Solving an oblique triangle (SAS case):**
1. Use the Law of Cosines to find the unknown side.
2. Use the Law of Sines to find a second angle.
3. Find the third angle using: angle sum = 180 degrees.

**Solving an oblique triangle (AAS/ASA case):**
1. Find the third angle: C = 180 - A - B.
2. Use the Law of Sines to find the unknown sides.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Ambiguous case of Law of Sines (SSA)**: When given two sides and an angle opposite one of them, there may be 0, 1, or 2 solutions. Be careful!
- **Calculator angles**: Make sure your calculator is in DEGREE mode, not RADIAN mode.
- **Half-angle formulae**: These are complex. Write them down on a formula card and practice using them repeatedly.
- **3D trigonometry**: Draw the 3D figure carefully. Identify the right triangles within the 3D shape. Solve them one at a time.
- **Units**: Check whether the problem uses degrees or radians. Convert if necessary.

### Quick Self-Test
1. In triangle ABC, a = 7, b = 8, C = 60 degrees. Find c.
   > **Answer**: c squared = 49 + 64 - 2(7)(8)cos(60) = 113 - 56 = 57. **c = sqrt(57) approximately 7.55**

2. Find the area of a triangle with sides 5, 6, 7.
   > **Answer**: s = (5+6+7)/2 = 9. Area = sqrt(9 times 4 times 3 times 2) = sqrt(216) = **6sqrt(6) approximately 14.7 sq units**

3. In triangle ABC, A = 45 degrees, B = 75 degrees, a = 10. Find b.
   > **Answer**: By Law of Sines: b/sin(75) = 10/sin(45). b = 10 times sin(75)/sin(45) = 10 times 0.9659/0.7071 = **approximately 13.66**

### Pro Tips
- Make a formula sheet for this chapter. There are many formulae, and having them all in one place helps enormously.
- When solving triangles, always identify what you know (SSS, SAS, AAS, ASA, SSA) first. That tells you which formula to use.
- For 3D problems, extract the relevant 2D right triangles from the 3D figure. Solve each right triangle using basic SOH-CAH-TOA.
- Double-check: do your answers satisfy the triangle inequality (sum of any two sides > third side)?

## Chapter 9: Chords and Arcs of a Circle (Pages 196-214)

### What You Will Learn
Welcome to circle geometry! This chapter introduces fundamental theorems about chords and arcs. You will learn about the relationship between chords and their distance from the centre, congruent chords and arcs, and how to calculate arc length, chord length, and sector area. These theorems form the basis for all further circle geometry.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Basic circle terminology (radius, diameter, chord, arc, sector, segment)
- Congruence of triangles (SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS)
- Pythagoras theorem
- Basic angle properties

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Only one circle** can pass through three non-collinear points.
2. **Perpendicular from centre to chord**: A line from the centre perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord. (And conversely, a line from the centre that bisects a chord is perpendicular to it.)
3. **Equidistant chords**: Two chords equidistant from the centre are congruent (equal in length). And vice versa.
4. **Congruent arcs have equal chords**: If two arcs are congruent, their corresponding chords are equal. And vice versa.
5. **Equal chords subtend equal central angles**: If two chords are equal, they subtend equal angles at the centre.
6. **Arc length**: l = (theta / 360) times 2 times pi times r (for theta in degrees).
7. **Sector area**: A = (theta / 360) times pi times r squared.

### Step-by-Step Method
**Proving a chord theorem (general approach):**
1. Draw the figure clearly, labeling all given information.
2. Draw any helpful construction lines (often from the centre to the chord, or connecting relevant points).
3. Identify congruent triangles using the given conditions and basic properties (radii are equal, etc.).
4. Use CPCT (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles) to prove the required result.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Drawing construction lines**: You often need to draw the perpendicular from the centre to a chord. This is a very common step in proofs -- do not forget it.
- **"If and only if" theorems**: Many theorems in this chapter are biconditional (they work both ways). Know both directions.
- **Arc vs chord**: Arc is the curved portion of the circle between two points. Chord is the straight line between two points. Different concepts!
- **Sector area vs segment area**: Sector = triangle + segment. Segment area = Sector area - Triangle area.

### Quick Self-Test
1. A chord of length 8 cm is drawn in a circle of radius 5 cm. Find the distance of the chord from the centre.
   > **Answer**: Half chord = 4. Distance = sqrt(5 squared - 4 squared) = sqrt(25-16) = **3 cm**

2. Find the arc length for a sector with radius 7 cm and central angle 60 degrees.
   > **Answer**: l = (60/360) times 2 times pi times 7 = (1/6) times 14pi = **7pi/3 cm approximately 7.33 cm**

3. True or False: Two chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are always equal in length.
   > **Answer**: **True**

### Pro Tips
- Always draw a neat, labeled diagram. Circle geometry problems become much clearer with a good figure.
- When you see a chord in a problem, consider drawing the perpendicular from the centre to it. This creates right triangles, which you can solve.
- Practice writing proofs step by step. State the theorem you are using at each step.

## Chapter 10: Tangents and Angles of a Circle (Pages 215-231)

### What You Will Learn
Building on Chapter 9, you will now explore tangent lines and the angle relationships within circles. You will learn about tangent properties, circles touching each other, the relationship between central and inscribed angles, the alternate segment theorem, and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. This chapter is proof-heavy and very important for exams.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- All theorems from Chapter 9 (chords and arcs)
- Properties of triangles (angle sum, isosceles triangle properties)
- Understanding of supplementary and complementary angles
- Familiarity with tangent lines from earlier math

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Tangent is perpendicular to radius**: At the point of contact, the tangent and the radial segment are at 90 degrees.
2. **Equal tangents**: Two tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle are equal in length.
3. **Circles touching externally**: Distance between centres = sum of radii (r1 + r2).
4. **Circles touching internally**: Distance between centres = difference of radii (|r1 - r2|).
5. **Central angle = 2 times inscribed angle**: The angle at the centre is double the angle at any point on the remaining arc.
6. **Angles in the same segment are equal**: Any two angles subtended by the same chord from the same side are equal.
7. **Angle in a semicircle = 90 degrees**: Any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
8. **Cyclic quadrilateral**: Opposite angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

### Step-by-Step Method
**Proving circle theorems:**
1. Draw the figure with all given information labeled.
2. Mark radii (all equal), tangent properties (90 degree angles), and any given relationships.
3. Identify isosceles triangles (two sides are radii).
4. Use angle relationships (angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees) to build your proof.
5. State your conclusion clearly.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Central vs inscribed angle**: The central angle is at the CENTRE. The inscribed angle is on the CIRCLE. The central angle is always double. Do not mix them up.
- **Alternate segment theorem**: The angle between a tangent and a chord equals the inscribed angle in the alternate segment. This theorem often appears in exam problems.
- **Cyclic quadrilateral**: ONLY works for quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle. If the quadrilateral is not cyclic, opposite angles are NOT necessarily supplementary.
- **"Greater than" and "less than" semicircle**: Angle in a segment greater than a semicircle is acute (< 90). Angle in a segment less than a semicircle is obtuse (> 90).

### Quick Self-Test
1. If the inscribed angle is 35 degrees, what is the central angle subtended by the same arc?
   > **Answer**: Central angle = 2 times 35 = **70 degrees**

2. In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, angle A = 110 degrees. Find angle C.
   > **Answer**: Opposite angles are supplementary: angle C = 180 - 110 = **70 degrees**

3. Two tangents are drawn from an external point P to a circle with centre O. If angle between the tangents is 60 degrees, find the angle POA (where A is one point of tangency).
   > **Answer**: The line PO bisects the angle between tangents. Angle OPA = 30 degrees. Since OA is perpendicular to PA, angle POA = 90 - 30 = **60 degrees**

### Pro Tips
- Many problems combine multiple theorems. Learn to chain them together: use the tangent-radius theorem to find one angle, then use the inscribed angle theorem to find another.
- For proofs, always start with what is given and work toward what is required. Mark known angles on your diagram as you go.
- Create a "theorem card" with all the circle theorems listed. Review it before your exam.

## Chapter 11: Practical Geometry of Circles (Pages 232-244)

### What You Will Learn
This is a hands-on, construction-based chapter. Using only a ruler/straightedge and compass, you will learn to locate the centre of a circle, draw a circle through three points, complete a circle from an arc, draw tangents (from points on the circle, outside the circle, and to arcs), and construct direct and transverse common tangents to two circles.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Confident use of compass and straightedge
- Perpendicular bisector construction
- Right angle construction
- All theorems from Chapters 9 and 10

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Locating the centre**: Draw two chords. Construct the perpendicular bisector of each. Their intersection is the centre.
2. **Circle through 3 non-collinear points**: The perpendicular bisectors of the triangle formed by the 3 points meet at the circumcentre. Draw the circle from there.
3. **Tangent at a point on a circle**: Draw the radius to that point. The tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.
4. **Tangent from an external point**: Draw the line from the external point to the centre. Bisect it to find the midpoint. Draw a circle with this midpoint as centre and the half-segment as radius. The intersection points with the original circle are the points of tangency.
5. **Direct common tangents** (external): Both tangents do not cross the line joining the centres.
6. **Transverse common tangents** (internal): The tangents cross between the two circles.

### Step-by-Step Method
**Drawing a tangent from an external point P to a circle with centre O:**
1. Join P to O.
2. Find the midpoint M of PO by constructing the perpendicular bisector of PO.
3. With centre M and radius MO, draw a circle.
4. This new circle intersects the original circle at two points, say T1 and T2.
5. PT1 and PT2 are the required tangents.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Accuracy matters**: Use a sharp pencil and be precise with your compass. Even a small error can make your construction look wrong.
- **Constructions without centre**: Some problems ask you to draw a tangent to an arc without knowing the centre. Use the property that the tangent is perpendicular to the chord at the midpoint of the arc.
- **Common tangents to unequal circles**: This requires careful auxiliary construction. Follow the textbook steps exactly.
- **Label everything**: Always label your construction lines, centres, and points of tangency. This helps the examiner (and you) follow your work.

### Quick Self-Test
1. How do you locate the centre of a given circle?
   > **Answer**: Draw two non-parallel chords. Construct the perpendicular bisector of each chord. The point where the two bisectors meet is the centre.

2. What is the first step to draw a tangent from a point on the circle?
   > **Answer**: Draw the radius to that point. The tangent will be perpendicular to this radius.

3. How many common tangents can two non-overlapping, non-touching circles have?
   > **Answer**: **4** (2 direct/external + 2 transverse/internal)

### Pro Tips
- Practice each construction at least 3 times before the exam. Muscle memory matters.
- In the exam, show ALL construction lines (do not erase them). They carry marks.
- Use a good quality compass that does not slip. A loose compass can ruin your construction.
- Start with a rough sketch before doing the actual construction. This helps you plan your space on the paper.

## Chapter 12: Basic Statistics (Pages 245-278)

### What You Will Learn
This comprehensive chapter covers data analysis and probability. You will construct cumulative frequency tables and ogives, find quartiles/deciles/percentiles, create and interpret box-and-whisker plots, analyze scatter diagrams and lines of best fit, calculate measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and solve probability problems involving combined events using tree diagrams, Venn diagrams, and the addition/multiplication rules.

### Before You Start (Prerequisites)
- Mean, median, mode (from 9th grade)
- Grouped frequency tables
- Basic probability concepts
- Plotting on coordinate axes

### Key Points to Remember
1. **Cumulative frequency**: Running total of frequencies. The ogive (S-curve) plots cumulative frequency against upper class boundaries.
2. **From the ogive**: Q1 at 25% of total frequency, Q2 (median) at 50%, Q3 at 75%.
3. **IQR** (Interquartile Range) = Q3 - Q1. Measures the spread of the middle 50% of data.
4. **Box-and-whisker plot**: Shows minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum. The box shows the IQR.
5. **Scatter diagram**: Plots paired data. Shows correlation (positive, negative, none).
6. **Variance**: sigma squared = (sum of f times (x - mean) squared) / sum of f. **Standard deviation** = sqrt(variance).
7. **Coefficient of variation**: CV = (SD / mean) times 100%. Used to compare variability of two data sets.
8. **Probability rules**:
   - Addition rule (mutually exclusive): P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
   - Addition rule (not mutually exclusive): P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
   - Multiplication rule (independent events): P(A and B) = P(A) times P(B)
   - Multiplication rule (dependent events): P(A and B) = P(A) times P(B|A)

### Step-by-Step Method
**Calculating standard deviation for grouped data:**
1. Find the mean: mean = (sum of f times x) / (sum of f), where x is the class mark.
2. Calculate (x - mean) for each class.
3. Square each deviation: (x - mean) squared.
4. Multiply by frequency: f times (x - mean) squared.
5. Sum all: sum of f times (x - mean) squared.
6. Divide by total frequency: variance = sum / N.
7. Take the square root: SD = sqrt(variance).

**Drawing a box-and-whisker plot:**
1. Find the five-number summary: minimum, Q1, median (Q2), Q3, maximum.
2. Draw a number line covering the data range.
3. Draw a box from Q1 to Q3.
4. Draw a vertical line at the median inside the box.
5. Draw whiskers from the box to the minimum and maximum.

### Tricky Parts and How to Handle Them
- **Ogive**: Plot points at the UPPER class boundary (not the class mark). Connect with a smooth curve.
- **Variance formula**: Some students forget to divide by N at the end, or forget to take the square root for SD.
- **Probability traps**: "At least one" problems are best solved as 1 - P(none). "A or B" requires careful use of the addition rule (watch out for double counting).
- **Tree diagrams**: Make sure each set of branches sums to 1. Multiply along branches for "and," add between final outcomes for "or."
- **Dependent vs independent events**: If drawing without replacement, the probabilities change for the second draw (dependent). If with replacement, they stay the same (independent).

### Quick Self-Test
1. The quartiles of a data set are Q1 = 20, Q3 = 50. What is the IQR?
   > **Answer**: IQR = 50 - 20 = **30**

2. A data set has mean = 40, standard deviation = 8. Another has mean = 50, SD = 10. Which has more relative variability?
   > **Answer**: CV1 = (8/40) times 100 = 20%. CV2 = (10/50) times 100 = 20%. **Both have the same relative variability.**

3. A bag has 3 red and 5 blue balls. Two balls are drawn without replacement. Find the probability both are red.
   > **Answer**: P = (3/8) times (2/7) = **6/56 = 3/28**

4. Events A and B are mutually exclusive. P(A) = 0.3, P(B) = 0.5. Find P(A or B).
   > **Answer**: P(A or B) = 0.3 + 0.5 = **0.8**

### Pro Tips
- For cumulative frequency and ogive questions, set up the table carefully. One error propagates to all subsequent values.
- Always label your axes when drawing any graph (ogive, scatter diagram, box plot).
- For probability: draw a tree diagram whenever you are confused. It makes the problem visual and prevents errors.
- To compare two data sets, use the coefficient of variation (CV), not just the standard deviation alone.
- In the exam, show your working for variance/SD calculations step by step. Partial marks are available.

# PART 3: EXAM STRATEGY

## How to Read Math Exam Questions

1. **Read the question TWICE**: The first time for understanding, the second time for details. Many marks are lost because students miss a key word like "hence," "show that," "simplify," or "find all values."

2. **Underline key information**: Mark the given values, the required answer, and any conditions (like "x > 0" or "where a is not equal to 0").

3. **Identify the topic**: Ask yourself: "Which chapter is this from? Which method should I use?" This focuses your thinking.

4. **Look for command words**:
   - "Solve" = Find the value(s) of the unknown
   - "Simplify" = Reduce to simplest form
   - "Prove/Show that" = Start from one side and reach the other, OR start from given and reach required
   - "Find" = Calculate a specific numerical answer
   - "Verify" = Substitute the answer back and show it works
   - "State" = Write the answer directly (usually 1-2 lines, no working needed)
   - "Construct" = Use ruler and compass (show all construction arcs)

5. **Check the marks**: If a question is worth 5 marks, a one-line answer is probably not enough. The marks hint at how much working is expected.

## Time Allocation for a 3-Hour Exam

Assuming a typical paper structure (adjust based on your actual paper pattern):

| Section | Content | Suggested Time | Tips |
|---------|---------|---------------|------|
| **Section A: MCQs** | 15-20 multiple choice questions | 20-25 minutes | Do not spend more than 1-1.5 minutes per MCQ. If stuck, mark it and come back. |
| **Section B: Short Questions** | 8-10 questions, choose some | 60-70 minutes | ~7 minutes per question. Show all steps clearly. |
| **Section C: Long Questions** | 4-5 detailed questions | 70-80 minutes | ~15-18 minutes per question. Plan before you write. |
| **Review Time** | Check all answers | 15-20 minutes | Re-check calculations, ensure you answered every required part. |

**Golden Rule**: Do NOT spend too long on any single question. If you have been stuck for 5 minutes, move on and come back later.

---

## Presentation Tips

1. **Write neatly**: A clean, well-organized answer sheet makes a positive impression on the examiner. Use a ruler for underlining.

2. **Start each question on the approach**: Write "Given:", "Required:", "Solution:" for structured problems.

3. **Show all working**: Even if you can do it in your head, write it down. You get marks for each step, not just the final answer.

4. **Box or underline your final answer**: Make it easy for the examiner to find your answer.

5. **Use proper mathematical notation**: Write fractions properly, use the correct symbols for inequalities, draw arrows on vectors, etc.

6. **For proofs**: Number your steps. State the reason for each step (e.g., "radii of same circle are equal" or "angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees").

7. **For constructions**: Use a sharp pencil. Show all arcs and construction lines. Do NOT erase construction marks. Label all points clearly.

8. **For graphs**: Label axes, use an appropriate scale, mark key points, and draw a smooth curve (not jagged lines between points).

## Common Exam Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Algebra Mistakes
| Mistake | Example | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Sign errors | -(3-2i) written as -3-2i | -(3-2i) = -3+2i. Distribute the negative to ALL terms. |
| Forgetting "plus or minus" | sqrt(x squared) = x | sqrt(x squared) = plus or minus x |
| Wrong factorization | x squared + 5x + 6 = (x+2)(x+4) | Check: (x+2)(x+3) = x squared + 5x + 6. Always verify by expanding. |
| Dropping solutions | Solving x(x-3) = 0, only writing x = 3 | x = 0 is also a solution! |

### Matrix Mistakes
| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| det[[a,b],[c,d]] = ad + bc | Determinant = ad - bc. Watch the minus sign! |
| AB = BA | Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative. Always compute in the given order. |
| Forgetting to check if determinant = 0 | Before finding inverse, ALWAYS check |A| first. If 0, inverse does not exist. |

### Trigonometry Mistakes
| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Calculator in wrong mode | Always set to DEGREE mode for degree problems. |
| Using law of sines for SAS | SAS requires Law of Cosines first, THEN use Law of Sines. |
| Rounding too early | Keep full decimal values during calculations. Only round the final answer. |

### Circle Geometry Mistakes
| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Confusing central and inscribed angles | Central angle is at the CENTRE. Inscribed angle is on the CIRCLE. |
| Assuming all quadrilaterals are cyclic | Only a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle is cyclic. |
| Not stating reasons in proofs | Every step in a proof needs a reason: theorem name, property, or definition. |

### Statistics Mistakes
| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Plotting ogive at class marks | Plot at UPPER class boundaries. |
| Forgetting sqrt for SD | Variance is NOT the same as SD. SD = sqrt(Variance). |
| P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) always | Only for mutually exclusive events. Otherwise subtract P(A and B). |

## Final Words of Encouragement

Mathematics is not about being "smart" or "not smart." It is about practice, patience, and persistence. Every problem you solve builds your skills. Every mistake you understand makes you stronger.

Here are some truths about math exams:

- **You do not need to solve every problem perfectly** to get excellent marks. Focus on accuracy in the questions you know, then attempt the harder ones.
- **Partial marks exist**. Even if you cannot finish a problem, write down what you know -- the formula, the setup, the first few steps. You may earn marks for these.
- **The exam tests what you have practiced**, not what you have memorized. So practice actively: solve problems, do not just read solutions.
- **Believe in yourself.** You have studied the material, you have this guide, and you are ready.

Good luck! You are going to do great.
