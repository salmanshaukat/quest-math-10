e Apply concepts of practical geometry of circles to real life word problems such as athletic tracks,
~, recreational parks, Ferris wheels and mechanical machines. ff
A circle is symmetric about its centre and any of its diameters. Architects often use the
circle's symmetrical properties when designing athletic tracks, recreational parks, buildings,
roundabouts, Ferris-wheels, etc. Artists and painters find the circle almost indispensable in
their work. Circular cylinders are used to print newspapers. Engineers exploit the circle's |
symmetrical properties as seen by the use of the circle in making watches, clocks, bicycles,
cars, trains, ships, aero-planes, radios, telephones, trolleys, wheel-barrows, air-conditioners,
rockets etc. Civilizations have progressed dramatically because of the invention of the
circular wheel. : .
