Cartesian product of any two non-empty sets A and B denoted by A × B (read as A cross B) is a
set containing all ordered pairs (x, y) such that × € A and y e B. We can write it as:

AXB= {(x,y)|xe AA yeB}
For example, if A = {a, b} and B = {2}, then _° + Ifn(A)=p and n(B) =,
All the subsets of A × B are: — : Ch ED om
Ri={}, Ro= {(a,2)}, Ra= {(b,2)} and R4= {(a, 2), (b, 2)}
Any subset of the cartesian product AxB is called a binary relation(or simply a relation) from set
A to set B. Basically, a binary relation relates an element of one set to an element of the other set.
All the above four subsets are binary relations from set A to set B,
Domain of any relation R denoted by dom(R) is a set containing first element of each ordered pair
in the relation. Dom(R,) = {a, b}
Range of a relation R denoted by ran(R) is a set containing second element of each ordered pair in
the relation, Ran(R,) = {2}
In R,, 2 is image of a and b but.a and b are preimages of 2

Function
A function f from set A to set B is a relation, rule or mapping which maps each element of set A
to a unique element of set B such that domain of f= A and there is no repetition in the first element
of ordered pairs in f.
Mathematically, it is written as f: A > B and is read.as fis a function from A to B.
In the above example in which A = {a, b} and’B = {2}, : a —

Therefore, R, is a function. Na a,
The first element of each ordered pair in Ry is called pre-image while
its corresponding second element is called image of the first element. Ry, Re and R3 are not:

Domain of a Function
A set containing first element of each ordered pair in the function is called its domain.
Range of a Function :
A set containing second element of each ordered pair in the function is called its range.
If f is a function from set A to set B, i.e., f: A+B, then Bis called co-domain of f and range
of fis a subset of co-domain.

Is f= {(1, 2), (2, 3),G, 2)} a function from A to B? but its converse is not true.
Solution: A= {l, 2,3} , B= {2,3} Do you agree?
Here fis a subset of A × B and dom f= {1, 2,3} =A.
. Also, there is no repitition in the first element of the ordered pairs in f, therefore f is a function.
Example: Which of the following relations indicated by the given figures are functions?

Solution: Here f, g and h are functions asthe domain of each of them is equal to their
corresponding first set and no first element is repeated in their respective mapping.
But in mapping t, dom(t) # P( 2 has no image in set Q) and there is repetition of 0 (~ it is mapped
to two elements 7 and 9 of Q), therefore t is not a function.
_ Inmapping p, dom(p) # L (~ b has no image in set M), so.p is not a function.
In mapping q, although dom(q) = S but b is repeated (~- it is the pre-image of two elements 2 and
3 of T), therefore q is not a function.
Types of Functions -
Range of a function is required for identifying the type of a function.
For any two non-empty sets A and B, these are the five types of functions: __f

1-1 function. Set B

Dom(R,) = {2, 3, 5} = A, but there is repitition in the first element of first two ordered pairs,
therefore R, is not a function. |
(il) R2= {(3, i), (2, 0), (5, 1)}
Dom(Rz2) = {2,3,5} =A and there is no repitition in the first element of the ordered pairs in Rp,

Dom(R3) = {2, 3, 5} = A and there is no repitition in the first element of the ordered pairs in R3,
therefore R3 is a function.
Range(R3) = {i, 0, u}¢ B which implies that R; is an into function. Also, there is no repitition in
the second element of the ordered pairs in R3, so R3 is one-one function.
Hence, R3 is an.injective function. :
Also number of elements in set B is more than number of elements in set A, therefore A onto
B function is not possible; |
Evaluating a Function
A function is usually written as y = f(x), in which the values of y (dependent variable) depends
upon the values of × (independent variable) and is as ‘y is a function of x’ or simply y is equal
to f of x’.
Evaluation of a function is a process of finding the value of dependent variable by substituting any
specific value of the independent variable.
Example: Find the value of f(x) = —2x3 + x² at: :
() {(-1) (il) f(t) di) dy) +2)
Solution: (1) Substituting × = −1 in f(x) = —2x3 + x², we have
f(−1)= —2(−1)? + (−1)? = —2(-1) + 1 =3
(il) Replacing × by t in f(x), we have
f(t) = —2(t)? + (¢)? = —2¢3 + t?
(iff) Substituting x= = in f(x), we have
= -2(F) +) =-2) +3-3
(iv) Replacing × by × + 2 in f(x), we have

= —2(x3 + 8 + 6x² + 12x) + (x² + 4x +4)

Operations on Functions
Operations on functions are the ways of combining functions to create new functions. Some
common operations on any two functioris f(x) and g(x) are:
(i) Addition of functions: (f+ g)( x) = f(x) + g(x).
For example, if f(x) = x² and g(x) = 2x, then
(£+ g)( x) = fx) + g(x) =x² + 2x : ,
(ii) Subtraction of functions: (f — g)( x) = f(x) — g(x).
For example, if f(x) = 2x* + 3x and p(x) = x² — 2x , then,
(f — g)( x) = f(x) — g(x) = (2x² + 3x) —(x² — 2x)
=2x* 43x —x2 + 2x =x² + 5x ot
(iii) Multiplication of functions: (fx g)( x) = f(x) × g(x). ;
For example, if f(x) =x² and g(x) = —2x, then (f × g)(x) = f(x) × g(x) |
=x" × (—2x) =—2x3
(iv) Division of functions: (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) , where e(x)* 0
For example, if f(x) = x² and g(x) = 2x, then (f + g)(x) = f(x)-+g(x)
Z
=x² +(2x)== ==
(v) | Composition of functions: The composition of f(x) and g(x) is a function denoted by fog
and is defined as:
(fog)( x) = f(g(x))
_ For example, if f(x) = x² and g(x) = 2x —1, then:
(fog)( x)= f(ge(x)) = f(2x −1) = (2x -−1)? = 4x² —4x41
_ Inother words, the output of inner function g(x) will become the input of the outer function
f(x). , -
—_ In this example, we first applied the function g to x, which resulted in 2 × — 1, then applied
the function f to the result which gave us (2x — 1)?.
Furthermore, for finding (gof)( x), f(x) will be the input of the outer function g(x).
So, (gof)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x²) = 2x² — 1
* — (fog)(x) and (gof)(x) can simply be written as_fg(x) and gf (x) respectively.

Example: Aahil wants to have anew bike which costs 24000 rupees but he has only a saving of
12000 rupees. If his parents have agreed to give him additional 1000 rupees per week for doing
chores. However, he also spends 500 rupees per week on snacks. How much will Aahil have as his

--- Page 122 ---

saving after 10 weeks. Also, tell in how many weeks he will be able to save the money for getting
a new bike?
Solution: Aahil’s saving function: S(x) = 12000 + 1000x , where × represents number of weeks
His spending function: T(x) = 500x
Total money with Aahil after × weeks = S(x) — T(x)
= 12000 + 1000x — 500x = 12000 + 500x
After 10 weeks, saving with Aahil = 12000 + 500(10) = 17000 rupees
Now, 24000 = 12000 + 500x =>24000 - 12000 = 500x => × =" = 24
Hence, he can save required amount in 24 weeks. -
Inverse of a Function
The inverse of any function f(x) is a function denoted by f~(x) which reverses the effect of f(x)
and it undoes what f(x) does, If: X — Y, then f~?: Y > X, therefore inverse of only that function
exists which is bijective(both one-one and onto).
Thus, if y =/(x) √x € X, thenx = f~1(y) V y & Y. It can be illustrated in the following diagram
as :
X(Domainoff) Y (Range of f)
won / | Mathematically,
X (Range of f-") ¥ (Domaht'off”") AF -*@)) = F* FD) = x
: fo)
It is clear from above diagram that domain of f= range of f~1 and range of f= domain of f~'.
Finding the Inverse of an Algebraic Function
If f(x) is any algebraic function, then its inverse f—?(x) involves the following steps:
lL Write y=/(x) |
Il. Find the value of × in terms of y from the equation of step I, means write × in terms of y.
III. Replace × by f~1(y) in the resulting equation of step II.
IV. . Replace each y by × in the resulting equation of step III to get f-*(@).
The result obtained in step IV can be verified by showing f~*(f(x)) = x.
Example: If f: RR is defined by f(x) = 3x +3 , find f—1(x).
Solution: Writing f(x) = y, we have,
y=3x+5
3x =y— 1-97 3 y= 2 (Isolating x)

A polynomial function of no degree is called a zero polynomial function. This function is of the
form:

The graph of y = 0 is a straight line that lies on the x-axis indicating that the value of y is always
zero regardless of the value of x. It passes through origin and extends infinitely in both positive

The graph of a linear equation is a straight line. For sketching the graph of a linear function, we
first find two points which satisfy the given equation. It is convenient to find x-intercept and
y-intercept for getting two points. | , . y-intercept |

The point where the graph intersects y-axis is (0, 3).
From the graph, it is clear that this line does not pass through origin. We can find the coordinates
of any point on the graph just by taking its distance from the axis.

Solution: *
Profit function, P(x) = |2x — 100| )
Substituting × = 120, P(120)=|2 × 120 — 100] = 140
Thus, the company makes a profit of 140 rupees.
Example:
A wave’s energy (E) is given by the function £(x) = |3sin (x)|, where × is the wave’s phase angle
in radians. If the phase angle is 30°, what is the wave’s energy ? . .
Solution:
First convert phase angle to radians as under:
Phase angle = 30° × = radians = - radians
Now substitute × = = in the given function,

(i) Quadratic Function 7
A polynomial function of degree two is called a quadratic function. This function is of the form,
f(@)=ax*+bx+c :a,b,ceRanda+ 0. .
For example, y = x² — 2x —3 , y=—4x² +1 are quadratic functions. ,
The graph of a quadratic function is a'U-shaped curve called parabola that opens either upward (if
a > 0) or downward (if a < 0). .

(where y attains minimum value) "
The vertical line passing through the vertex of parabola is called ‘axis of symmetry’ as the graph
is symmetrical about y-axis.
In order to sketch the graph of such quadratic functions, follow the following steps.
Step-2: Find x-intercept and y-intercept.
Step-3: Find the vertex of the parabola.
For finding vertex of the parabola, we proceed as follows:
y =ax*+bx+c

Determining the Gradient of Curves through Tangents
The gradient of a curve at a given point is the slope of the tangent line drawn to the curve at that
point. It is obtained by drawing a tangent to the curve at that point. The tangent to a curve is a line
which touches the curve onle at one point externally. The slope of tangent to the curve is its

Real Life Problems Related to Functions and Graphs
Graphs and functions are essential: tools in various aspects of daily life. They have wide
applications often unconsciously in solving many real life problems including distance and time,
supply and demand, ‘temperature and time, population growth, health and fitness, weather
forecasting, financial planning, time management, medical research, environmental monitoring,
fitness tracking etc. By applying graphs and functions to daily life problems, we can develop a
more analytical approach to decision making and problem solving.
Here are some problems involving functions and their graphs.
