‘PREFACE
Textbook of Mathematics for Grade 10 has been developed by NBF according to the
National Curriculum of Pakistan 2022- 2023. The aim of this experimentation skills is to
enhance learning abilities through inculcation of logical thinking in learners, and to
develop higher order thinking processes by systematically building upon the foundation of
learning from the previous grades. Akey emphasis of the present experimentation skills is
_ on creating reai life linkages of the concepts and methods introduced. This approach was
devised with the intent of enabling students to solve daily life problems as they go up the
learning curve and for them to fully grasp the conceptual basis that will be built upon in
subsequent grades.
After amalgamation of the efforts-of experts and experienced author, this book was
reviewed and finalized after extensive reviews by professional educationists. Efforts
were made to make the contents student.friendly and to develop the concepts in
interesting ways.
The National Book Foundation is always striving for improvement in the quality of its
books. The present book features an improved design, better illustration and interesting
activities relating to real life to make it attractive for young learners. However, there is
always room for improvement and the suggestions and feedback of students, teachers and
the community are most welcome for further enriching the subsequent editions of this
| May Allah guide and help us (Ameen). .

‘Applications of Mathematics :
Complex Numbers: Complex numbers play a critical role in fields such as engineering,
electronics, and quantum physics. They are especially valuable for modeling oscillations in
alternating current (AC) circuits, which are foundational to modern electrical systems, and for
analyzing waveforms and resonances that occur naturally in many types of physical systems.
Quadratic Equations: Quadratic equations model a range of phenomena. In physics, they
describe projectile motion; in finance, they are used for profit and cost optimization; and in
architecture, they inform structural designs by calculating load distributions and parabolic
shapes for stability.
Matrices and Determinants; Matrices are essential in solving complex systems of equations and
executing transformations in areas like computer graphics and machine learning. Determinants,
closely related to matrix invertibility, provide insights into properties of shapes and can be used
to calculate area, volume, and to determine if linear systems have unique solutions.
Linear and Quadratic Inequalities: Linear and quadratic inequalities express ranges of values
that satisfy given conditions, such as acceptable income levels, speed limits, or temperature
thresholds. In real life, they are essential in budgeting, optimizing resources in industries,
setting safety regulations, and environmental monitoring, where certain parameters must stay
within safe or efficient boundaries.
Algebraic Fractions: Algebraic fractions simplify relationships found in finance (like calculating
compound interest), physics (such as wave motion and light refraction), and data science (for
probability ratios and odds in statistical models). They allow complex relationships to
expressed in simpler, comparable terms.
Functions and Graphs: Functions are mathematical tools that map inputs to outputs, visualized
through graphs to represent relationships between variables, such as speed over time, cost
versus quantity, or population growth over years. These graphical representations are
fundamental in economics, biology, and physics, where understanding variable relationships is
key to predicting and modeling real-world changes.
Vectors: Vectors combine magnitude and direction, making them indispensable in applications
like navigation, physics (force and velocity calculations), and engineering (stress analysis in
materials). In computer graphics, they help in rendering movements and 3D transformations,
contributing to realistic visualizations.
Trigonometry: Trigonometry is crucial for solving right and non-right triangles. Its applications
span navigation, construction, and astronomy, where precise distance and angle measurements
are essential, from mapping locations to constructing stable structures.
Chords and Arcs of a Circle: Understanding chords and arcs forms the basis of circular geometry,
used extensively in design, architecture, and mechanical engineering, where curves and circular
components (like gears or wheels) must be accurately measured and constructed.
Tangents and Its Construction: A tangent touches a circle at one point, forming a right angle
with the radius at that point. This principle has practical applications in road and race track
design gear construction, and analyzing rotational motion, where precision at points of contact
is crucial. Constructing tangents, arcs, and circular sections is fundamental in structural design,
architecture, bridge engineering, and urban planning.
Statistics: Statistics, through measures like mean, median, mode, range, and standard
deviation, help summarize and interpret data trends. Statistics play an essential role in business
forecasting, healthcare analytics, social sciences, and environmental studies, where decisions
must be made based on reliable data insights.
