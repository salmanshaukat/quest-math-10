Until the sixteenth century, mathematicians were puzzled by square roots of a negative numbers.
For example, the solutions of.x² — 2 = 0 are √2, and — √2. But what are the solution of x² + 2 = 0?
To find the solution of this equation, imaginary numbers were defined.
A French mathematician René Descartes was the first to emphasize the imaginary nature of
numbers, positing that “one can imagine as many (numbers) as already mentioned in each
equation, but sometimes, there is no quantity that matches what we imagine.”
However, in 16th century an Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, proved that having a
negative term inside a square root can lead to the solution of an equation. .
Later, in the 18th century, mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss consolidated Cardano’s
premises, in addition to developing a treatise on complex numbers in a plane and thereby
established the modern bases of the term. .

Imaginary and Complex Numbers
Negative numbers do not have square roots in the real number system. However, a larger number
_ system that contains the real number system is designed so that negative numbers do have square
roots. This system is called the complex number system and it makes use of a number that is a
square root of −1. We call this new number i. ee,

Imaginary Number
An imaginary number is a number that can be written a+5i, where a and b are real
numbers, 520.

Complex Numbers ,

When a and 8 are real numbers and b is allowed to be 0, the number a+ / is said to be complex.
A complex number is any number that can be written in the form of a+5i, where a and 6 are
any real numbers and both a and 6 can be zero.

Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers
The complex numbers obey the commutative, associative and distributive law. Thus, we can add anc
subtract them as we do binomials. Moreover, the sum and difference of two complex numbers is also :
complex number. Ifz, =a + bi and z,=c + di are two complex numbers then their sum and difference i:
defined as:
Sum: Add real part.in real part and imaginary part in imaginary part.
Z, + Z2= (a + bi) +(c + di)=(a +c) +(b+d)i ,
Difference: Subtract real part in real part and imaginary part in imaginary part.
“Z, —Z,=(a + bi) -(e + di) =(a—c)+ (b-ad)i
Example: Simplify:
a. (74+5i)+(44+3i) b. (5+6f)-(7-4i)
Solution: . | |
a, (7+5i)+(4+3i) p, (5+6i)-(7-4i)
=7+5i+44+3i =5+6i-74+4i
= 7+4+5i+3i (combine real and =5-—7+6i+4i (combining real and

Multiplication of Complex Numbers .
Ifa + bi and c + di are two complex numbers then their product can be found by using distributive
law.
(a + bi\(c + di) = ale + di) + bile + di) = ac + adi + bei + bd?*
=ac +adi+bci-bd =(ac—bd)+(ad+be)i .....(as2=-1) -
Therefore, the product of two complex numbers is also:a complex number. .
For complex numbers, the property VaVb =~J/ab does not hold in general, but it does when a -
is negative and b is a non-négative number, —
_ To express square root of negative numbers, we first express them in terms of i. For example:
‘ √-3x4/ —7 = -1√3 × J-1√7 = i3xiv7 = 7/21 =—√21: correct: :
But, f-2 x√-5 = J-Q)-5) = VI0 is wrong.
_ Example: Multiply and simplify:
a. V—2v-11 b. —2i.5i c. —3i(2 —Bi)
d. V—9 /—36 e. (3—2i)(1 + Si) ff. 6-09-30

b. —2i.5i = —10(i²) = —10(−1) = 10 (as i² = −1)

c. —3i(2 —8i) = —6i + 24(i7) = -6i + 24(−1) = —6i — 24 = —24 - Gi

d. V—9¥—36 = V—-1x 9 v−1 × 36 = V—1√9 × V—1√36 = i3 × i6 = 1817 = -18

e. (3—2{)(1+5i) = 3+ 15i—2i — 10? = 3 + 13 — 10(—-1) = 13 + 13%

f (5—i)(9 —3i) = 45 — 15i — 91 + 3i* = 45 — 241 + 3(—-1) = 42 — 24
Powers of i .
We now want to simplify certain expressions involving higher powers of i. simplifying powers
of j can then be done by using the fact that i> =−1 and expressing the given power of / in terms
of i’. Consider: , .

4 (72)\2 = (-1)2 = 1

The powers of i cycle themselves through the values of i, -1, —i and |.

, Conjugates of Complex Numbers )

Conjugate of complex number is a complex number obtained by changing the sign of the
imaginary part. In simple words, conjugate of a complex number is a number that has the same
real part as the original complex number, and the imaginary part has the same magnitude but
opposite sign. “
The conjugate of a complex number a + ib is a — ib, .
For example, the conjugate of 5+ 6 is 5— 6 and that of 3—11i is 3+11i.
Commonly, the complex number is denoted by z and its conjugate by Z.
For example, if z=11+7/ then z= 11+ 7i = 11-—7i

Example: Find the conjugate: .
a. 5497 ~b. 13-Si c. —5—-Ti . d. Il
Solution: 7 |
a, 54+97 the conjugate is 5—9j b. 13—5y the conjugate is 13+5i
c. —5—7i the conjugate is —5+7/ d. 11i the conjugate is -11i
, Division of Complex Numbers
Dividing complex numbers is a little more complicated than addition, subtraction, and
multiplication of complex numbers because it is difficult to divide a number by an imaginary
number.
For dividing complex numbers, we need to find a term by which we can multiply the numerator and
the denominator that will eliminate the imaginary part of the denominator so that we end up with a
real number in the denominator.
Ifz,=x,+iy, andz,=x,+iy, are the two complex numbers, then division of z, by z, is written as:
a= 50%... (i) .
Zz X2+lyz
To eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator
of (i) by the conjugate of x, + iy, i.e. by x, — iy,
oo Zz = xXgtivz x2-iy2 a .
After that, we simplify the expression (ii).
Steps for Dividing Complex Numbers .
To divide the two complex numbers, follow these steps: .
« First, calculate the conjugate of the complex number-that is at the denominator of the
’ fraction. oo
. ¢ Multiply the conjugate with the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction.
: ° Apply the algebraic identity (a + b) (a—b) =a?—&* in the denominator and substitute
« Apply the distributive property in the numerator and simplify.
* Separate the real part and the imaginary part of the resultant complex number.

Additive Inverse of Complex Numbers .
If z= a+ biis a complex number then its additive inverse is -z = —a — bi.
In the same way, additive inverse of —z = —a — bi is z = a + Di.
Sum of a complex number and its additive inverse is zero.
z+(—z) = (a+ bi) + (-a— bi) =a+bi-—a—bi=0=0+01
Example: -
Find the additive inverse of 3—2i. vs 7 |
Solution: . Equality of Complex Numbers
Let.a+bi be the additive inverse of 3—2/. ee complex numbers sie:

Then by additive inverse rule: - -
(3 — 2i) + (a + bi) = 0 + 01 earEatend
(3 +a) +(-2i+ bd) =0+0i
(3 +a) + (—2+b)i=0+0i |
Comparing real and imaginary parts of both sides, we get:
3+a=0;-24+b=0 = a=-3;b=2
Thus, additive inverse of 3 = 2i is 3 + 2i.
- Direct Method: )
We can apply the rule that additive inverse is the opposite sign of 3-2 that is —3+2i,
Similarly the additive inverse of —7+11f is 7−1 li.

Geometrical Representation of Algebraic Operations

The graphical representation of algebraic operations in the complex number system
makes it easier to understand the concepts.
(i) Geometrical Representation of Addition QZ) RZ +25)
Geometrically, addition of two complex numbers z, and z, —a .
can be visualized as addition of the vectors by using the ij
parallelogram law. The vector sum Z, + 2, is represented [A PZ)
by the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the two “~~ Ol Real axix
original vectors. | a
If two points P and Q represent complex numbers z, and z,
respectively in the Argand Plane, then the sum z, + Z, is
represented by the point R of the diagonal OR of
parallelogram OPRQ having OP and OQ as two adjacent
sides. |
(ii) Geometrical Representation of Subtraction
The representation of the difference of two complex
numbers, is slightly complicated than the addition of the
complex numbers. The easiest way of presenting the
subtraction is to think of addition ofa negative vector.

--- Page 19 ---

If we want to represent z, — z,, then the easiest way of | of \ ;
representing it would be to think of adding a negative | . 2
vector z,+ (—z,). fi \e
The negative vector is the same as the positive one, the only | / 2
difference being that the negative vector points in the V _—"4u ft -
opposite direction. . iN | :
The difference vector z, —z, is represented in the Py Py No ;
adjoining figure. * | VY |
Pe
Itis important to note here that the vector representing the difference of the vectors z,—z, may
also be drawn joining the end point of z, to the tip of z, instead of the origin, This kind of
representation does not alter the meaning or interpretation of the difference operator.

Applications of Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are used in many fields in real life. Major Fields where complex numbers are used
Electronics — Electromagnetism Computer science engineering
Civil engineering Mechanical engineering Control systems. -
In modelling and problem solving, we find many equations whose roots are complex numbers.
Dealing such kind of problems, we must have conceptual understanding of complex numbers.
Practically, negative numbers do not have square roots in the number system. However, a large
number system that contains the real number system is designed so that negative numbers do have
square roots.

Sometimes we need factorization of the equation, but in real number system in some
expressions making factors are not possible, By using the complex numbers properties, we
can make factorization possible.
Example: Factorize:

Solution: .
a. Zz 49 : b. 32745
The factors of z* +9 are (z-—3/)(z +31) The factors are (√3z—iN5)(√3z +i 5)
Example: Mr. Wagas is an electrical engineer designing the electrical circuits for a new office
building. There are three basic things to be considered in an electrical circuit: The flow of the
electric current I, the resistance to that flow Z, called impedance, and electromotiye force E,
called voltage. Their quantities are related in the formula £=/Z . The current of the circuit
Waaas is designing is to be (35-—40./) amp. Electrical engineers use the letter J to represent the
imaginary ugit. Find the impedance of the circuit if the voltage is to be (430-330) volts.

_ Solution of System of Equations with Complex Coefficients
In this section, we shall find solution of different equations in complex variables either with
real or complex coefficients. Consider the following equation:
pz+qw=r.cai)
Where p, q and r are complex numbers (every real number is a complex number). The equation
(i) is called a linear equation in two complex variables z and w.
Pz+qwer
P,2+g,W=h, , .
These two equations together form a system of linear equations in two variables z and w. The
linear equations in two variables are also called simultaneous linear equations.
Example: Solve:
z+w=3i ; .
. 2z+3w=2
| Solution: Given equations are: .
