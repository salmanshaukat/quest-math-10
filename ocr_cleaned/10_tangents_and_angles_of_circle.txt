Tangents have several important applications across various fields, particularly in mathematics, physics,

engineering, and geometry. Some applications of tangents are:

* Tangents play an important role in the study of curves. They are lines that touch a curve at a single point,
perpendicular to the curve's radius at that point. Tangents are used to define geometric properties such as the
radius, diameter, chord, and arc length of circles.

* Tangents are used to design curves in buildings, such as arches and domes.

* Tangents are used to design curves in roads, bridges, and other structures. By using tangents, engineers can
create curves that are safe and efficient for travel.

* Tangents are used to analyse the motion of objects. For example, whena car or bike travels down a road, the
road becomes tangent at each location where the wheels roll. )
