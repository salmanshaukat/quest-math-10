Frequency Distribution

In statistics it is very important to represent a data in a manageable way so that it becomes easy
to understand, analyze and to draw useful results. This useful presentation of data can be made
by various methods. Grouped frequency distribution is one of the most important methods to
represent the quantitative data. Data can be classified in many ways for efficient usage and ,
productivity. In previous grades we have discussed two types of data

i. raw data (ungrouped data) ii. grouped data (frequency distribution)

Here we will study the construction of cumulative frequency distribution by revising frequency
polygon. , .

Frequency Polygon

Polygon is a many sided closed figure. To draw a frequency polygon mid points (class marks)
are marked on the horizontal axis and frequencies are marked on the vertical axis., Points are
plotted with class frequencies and their corresponding class marks. These points are joined by
straight line segments. To complete a closed polygon we add extra classes at both ends with zero
frequencies. In this way two extra points on x-axis are obtained on both ends. The points are
joined by their nearer plotted points. Finally a frequency polygon is obtained.

Cumulative Frequency Distribution
A table in which cumulative frequencies of classes are written against classes is called a
cumulative frequency table “The number of values of a data less than an upper-class boundary is
called its cumulative frequency”.

The cumulative frequency table is another way to analyze the frequency distribution. The
frequency distribution tells us how many values of the data are present within each class interval,
while a cumulative frequency tells.us how many values of a data are less than or within each
class interval.

In the following table cumulative frequencies are found and interval of 0 frequency is added at
the top. Column of upper class boundary is also included which are necessary for construction of
cumulative frequency polygon or ogive.

Cumulative Frequency Polygon and Cumulative Frequency Curve
(Ogive) |
A frequency distribution can also be represented by a cumulative frequency polygon or Ogive.
An ogive and a cumulative frequency polygon are related but distinct concepts in statistics and
data visualization. |
_ Cumulative Frequency Polygon
A frequency polygon made by taking cumulative frequency on y axis is called cumulative
. frequency polygon. It is made to wisualize the cumulative distribution ofa variable,
To draw a cumulative frequency polygon, the class boundaries are plotted on x-axis and
cumulative frequencies on y-axis. The points are marked on the graph using the upper class
boundaries and the respective cumulative frequencies. These points are joined by straight line
segments and the polygon is completed by drawing a vertical line segment to join the last marked
point with x-axis. Following is a cumulative frequency polygon representing the data given
above. , ) {

Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive) i oy Jae jaa
A graph showing the cumulative frequency (or cumulative relative frequency) of a variate ;
as a curve, with the x-axis showing the values of the variable and the y-axis showing the
respective cumulative frequency is called Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive).
It is also known as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) |

_ | : Measures of Distribution
These measures are used to understand the spread and distribution of the data, and are often used
with measures of central tendency to get a better understanding of the dataset. They include:

--- Page 250 ---

i. Quartiles bo
The three values which divide the whole data into four equal parts are called quartiles. Quartiles
are usually denoted by Q: , Q2 and Q;. The lower quartile Q; divides the data in | : 3. The middle
quartile Q2 divides the data in 1 : 1. It is infect nothing different from median of data. The upper
quartile Qs divides the data in 3: 1.
Ql= ri th value of data & Q2= (= == )" value of data = median
When data is arranged in some order, it can be represented by a single value that lies exactly at
the centre of data. “The central or middle most value of an arranged data is called its median’,
Q3= = th value of data
The quartiles can also be estimated graphically from a cumulative frequency polygon.
e To estimate Q; (lower quartile), mark = on y-axis.
* Draw a line parallel to x-axis from that point to intersect cumulative frequency polygon.
e Drop a perpendicular from this point of intersection to x-axis. The value of data where the
perpendicular meets x-axis is lower quartile Qi.
Similarly, Q2 and Qs; can be estimated from cumulative frequency curve, by marking > and 2
on y-axis and following the same procedure used for Qi.
Example:
The scores on a test were compiled into a dataset with the following quartiles:
Ql= 40, Q2 or median = 70, Q3= 90
What percentage of students scored above 90 on the test?
Solution: From the quartiles it is obvious that one fourth (25 percent) of the students scored
above 90.

ii. Deciles a ; :
Deciles divide a dataset or a distribution into 10 equal parts, each representing 10% of the data.
By looking at the deciles, we can get a sense of the shape of the distribution, including where the
majority of the data points are concentrated and where the outliers are lying.

Ten Deciles of a dataset are described as follows: Pe!

D1: lowest 10% of the data Deciles are often used in statistics,
D2: lowest 20% of the data economics, and social sciences to
D3: lowest 30% of the data understand the distribution ofa ee

- variable, such as:‘income, wealth or

D10: highest decile under which100% of the data lies. ee .

Example; A company wants to analyze the salaries of its employees. The related department

compiles a dataset and calculates the deciles. The deciles are as follows:

Pct ave Sasa SN Bak Ft

--- Page 251 ---

DI = Rs.40,000 , D5 or median = Rs.60,000 ; D10 = Rs.80,000
What percentage of employees earn a salary above Rs.60,000 but below Rs.80,000? .
Solution: From the above data, percentage of employees earning salaries above 60,000 and
below Rs. 80,000 are between D5(median) and D10 i.e 90 % — 50% = 40 %
(Remember: D10 represents highest 10 % i.¢ Rs. 80,000 and D9 represents below Rs. 80,000)
lil. Percentiles | |
_ Percentiles divide a dataset or a distribution into 100 equal parts, each representing 1% of the
data. It's a way to understand the distribution of a dataset or a variable by looking at the
percentage of data points that are below a specific value.
Some common percentiles include: _ _
* 25th percentile (Q1): 25% of data points are below this value. | Maths Play Ground: |
* 30th percentile (Q2 or median): 50% of data is below Q2. | Help students to design quiz wheel
« 75th percentile (Q3): 75% of data points are below this value, or quiz maonine For the |
* 90th percentile: 90% of data points are below this value. one aca of teense of
e 99th percentile: 99% of data points are below this value | i ; : |
Eee - : Ik a A ia 4 i : _ a _ : - _ _ i __ | __ a | : |
’ Percentiles are often used to:
understand the distribution of a variable (e.g., income, scores, masses). :
identify outliers,
compare individual values to the overall distribution. :
set benchmarks (e.g., top 10 %).
evaluate performance (e.g., moving up or down. in percentiles).
Example: Uzair scored in the 75th percentile on a test: Find how much percentage of the
students scored below him and how much percentage of students scored above him.
Solution: From the above information it is clear that the student's score is higher than 75% of
the total students. It means that
e 75% of the students scored below him ,
* 25% scored above him
iv. Inter Quartile Range
IQR=Q3-QI_.
The IQR represents the range of values within which the middle 50% of the data points fall. In
otlier words, it's the spread of the data within the middle half of the distribution,
IQR can describe: , :
Spread: A small IQR indicates less scattered, while a large IQR indicates more scattered data.
Variability: The IQR is a more efficient measure of variability than the Range.
Outliers: The IQR can help identify outliers. (data points beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the
quartiles are considered outliers), . |
Comparison: IQR is useful for comparing the spread of different datasets.

--- Page 252 ---

Example = #— oo a
A teacher wants to analyze the test scores of her students. She compiles a dataset as: ,
first quartile Q1 = 60 and third quartile Q3 = 95
a) What is the Interquartile Range (IQR) of the test scores?
b) What percentage of students scored between 60 and 95 (inclusive)? |
Solution: — )
a} The Interquartile Range (IQR) of the test scores is given by the relation:
b) As Q3 — QI represents spread of the middle half of a data set so 50% of students scored
between 60 and 95 (inclusive)
Example: ;
The adjoining figure shows an ogive representing the distribution of time in minutes spent by 60
preachers of SEED to deliver single Seerah lecture. Find Q1, Q2, Q3 and inter quartile range.

19 20 30f 40 50 60 70 80
Solution: Time spent |
To estimate the median time spent from ogive, we observe that 50 % (half of) preachers spent
less than or equal to the median time to deliver the lecture.
Median corresponds to the 5" decile and 50" percentile, i.e.
Median = Q2 = DS = P50 == × 60 = 30
From 30 on y-axis, draw a horizontal line to meet the curve and then draw a vertical line to mect
x-axis as in above figure. .
From the figure, we observe that median time to deliver a lecture is 43.5 minutes.
Lower quartile corresponds to 25th percentile i.e.
Q1 (the lower quartile) = P25 = one quarter (25% of) total frequency = : × 60= 15
From the curve, the lower quartile = 37 minutes.
Upper quartile corresponds to 75th percentile i.e.
Q3 (the upper quartile) = P75 = three quarters (75% of) total frequency = = × 60 =45
From the curve, the upper quartile = 50.5 minutes.
_ The inter Quartile Range = Q3 — QI = 50.5 — 37 = 13.5 .

The Box and Whisker Plot Correlation
Box-and-Whisker Plot (or simply box plot)
A box plot typically consists of the following components:
Box: A rectangular box that represents the interquartile range (IQR). The box is divided into two
parts by a vertical line, which represents the median (Q2) of the data.
Whiskers: Two horizontal lines that extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values
in the dataset, excluding outliers. The whiskers represent the range of the data.
Outliers: Data points that fall beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles are considered outliers
and are plotted individually.
Median: The vertical line inside the box represents the median (Q2) of the data.
Quartiles: The edges of box represent 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).
Box plots are useful for comparing datasets, identifying outliers, visualizing distribution and
summarizing data
Example: The given box and whisker plot shows the prices of stationery items, Hashir
purchased yesterday. ~~

a) What is the mediani price of an item?
b) what are the min & max prices of the items purchsed by Hashir² c) What is IQR of the data² d) what “age of items is above Rs. 800?
Solution:
a) From the box plot, it is clearly seen that median price of an item is Rs. 300
b) From the box plot, it is observed that min price of any item is Rs. 50 & max price of |
any itemisRs. 1000
c) IQR=Q3-QI =800- 160 = 640
d) As items between Q3 and Q4 are 25 % so “age of items above Rs. 800(Q3) is 25%.
Box and Whisker Plot Correlation
The | box and whisker plot correlation means the patterns or relationships between the _
distributions of two or more variables, Box and whisker plot correlations include:
1. Positive correlation:
lf the boxes and whiskers of both variables tend to move in the same direction (e.g., both
increase or decrease together), it may indicate a positive correlation.
2. Negative correlation:
If the DOxeS and whiskers of both variables tend to move in opposite directions (e.g., one
dncreases while the other decreases), it may indicate a negative correlation, |

--- Page 256 ---

3. No correlation: pe?
If the boxes and whiskers of both variables appear unrelated or don't show a clear pattern, it may
indicate no correlation.
Box and whisker plots only provide a visual representation and don't quantify the
correlation. Hitt

Construction of Scatter Diagram, Lines of Best Fit and
Interpretation of Data
Construction of a scatter diagram consists of: ;
i. Plotting the data points on a coordinate plane.
il. Representing each data point by a mark (e.g., dot, circle, or square).
We solve an example to understand the concept.
_ Example: — Table below shows the masses and heights of 11 boys.

(b) From the graph, it is observed that there is a strong positive correlation between masses
and heights of boys. More height, more the mass of boys.
(c) Line of best fit is drawn having almost half the data points on either sides of it.
(d) From scatter diagram, the boy with height 150cm should have a mass of 39 kg app.
Interpretation of a Scatter Diagram -
Pattern; There are several types of patterns: .
* Positive correlation: As × increases, y also increases.
«® Negative correlation: As × increases, y decreases.
* Nocorrelation: No apparent relationship between × and y.

Strength: Observe the strength of the relationship. A stronger relationship means the points are
closer to a straight line.
Outliers: Identify data points that don't fit the pattern.
Drawing Lines of Best Fit
A line of best fit helps to predict the value of a variable y for a given x. It is a line that appears to
fit the pattern. It may or may not pass through any data points however almost equal number of
points should lie on either side of it. The line of best fit can be represented by

It includes following steps: interpreting the results.
' Plot the data
Identify the pattern (Positive correlation, Negative correlation and No correlation)
Assess the strength (Strong correlation, Moderate correlation and Weak correlation)
Calculate the correlation coefficient r by:
e Identifying the data points (x, y) by coordinates of each point on the scatter plot.
e Finding the mean of the x-values (X) and the mean of the y-values (¥).
* Calculating the deviation from the mean for × (xi—) and y (yi — ¥).
e Multiplying the x-deviation by the y-deviation (xi — x)(yi — ¥).
e Adding up the multiplied deviations for all points.
« Dividing the sum of the products by the square root of the product of the sum of the
squared x-deviations and the sum of the squared y-deviations. i.e.

Where r is the correlation coefficient, ranging from −1 (perfect negative correlation) to | (perfect
positive correlation).
Interpret the results high r value i.e. close to 1 or — 1 means Strong correlation, Low r value
i.e. close to 0 means weak correlation & sign of r indicates the direction of the correlation i.e.
positive or negative.

Measures of Dispersion
The single value which can represent a data is known as average or measure of central tendency.
In grade 9, different types of averages e.g. mean, median and mode are studied.
Let us find the arithmetic mean of scores of five participants of a math quiz:
V (Bilal’s score)  =5,5,5,5,5 => port. 2 =5
irl a
W (Umer’s score) | =1,3,5, 8,8 => Por = = =5
X (Usman’s score) =2,4,5,6,8 a 2 =5
Y (Hassan’s score) =—10,0,10,12,13 => Fas? 2=5
Z (Abdullah’s score) =—15,—5, 10, 15,20 => Z= ef a 2 =5
We have seen that all of the above five data have same measure of central tendency (arithmetic
mean) but they vary in different ways. The values of above data are scattered away from their
average in different ways. It is a confusing situation because we are unable to compare the data
on the basis of their average. We can say that the average of a data is not more significant unless
the scatterings of values around the average are measured. ,
The techniques or formulas which are used to measure, how the values of a data are scattered
around its central value, are called measures of dispersion.
Types of Measures of Dispersion
(a) Range
Range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of the data. 1.€.
R =xm—Xo, where xm= maximum value and x»= Minimum value
(b) Variance
Variance is the mean of squared deviation taken from mean.
Usually it is denoted by S?. The formula for variance of grouped data:
gta 2/2 - = (Proper mean formula)
— @2a Efe? _ -Ef2 yirect formula)
or S*= oT ( 7 )* (Direct formula)
(c) Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a positive square root of variance. It is denoted by S and given by
following formulae:

--- Page 263 ---

S=_ pee (Proper mean formula)
a _ fez² — (ef%)2 (Direct formula’
or § or iS , (Direct formula)

Example: Data shows scores of Huffaz in a Hifz Quran test:

Find Range, variance and standard deviation of the data.

Solution: Range = Xm—Xo0 = 100-41 = 59

For the variance and SD, we need to construct the following table: .

C.V. is used to compare the dispersion of different data which differ in their means and
units. It is also used as a criterion for consistent performance. The data having smaller
C.V is more consistent than the data having larger C.V. }

1. Calculate the arithmetic mean of each data set.
2. Calculate the standard deviation of each data set.
3. Compare the means which indicates a difference in the central tendency of the two data sets.

. Probability
Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a number between 0 and |
both inclusive that represents the chance of an event happening. Here are some key concepts in
probability:
Experiment: An action or process that can produce a set of outcomes.
Outcome: A specific result of an experiment.
Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
Event: A set of one or more outcomes of an experiment.
Probability of an Event: A number between 0 and 1 both inclusive that represents the likelihood
of an event.
Types of Probability
There are several.types of probability such as:
* Theoretical Probability
The number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
® Experimental Probability
sed on the results of repeated trials of an experiment.
* Conditional Probability
The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
* Dependent Probability
The probability of two or more events occurring dependently on each other.
© Mutually Exclusive Probability
The probability of two or more events that cannot occur simultaneously.
* Joint Probability
The probability of two or more events occurring together.
Probability of Combined Events
The probability of combined events depends on whether the events are independent, dependent,
or mutually exclusive.
Probability of Independent Events
The probability of two or more independent events occurring is the product of their individual
_ probabilities.
ie. P(A and B) = P(A) =< P(B)
Probability of Dependent Events
The probability of two or more dependent events occurring is the product of their individual
probabilities, considering the conditional probability of each event.
ic, P(A and B)= P(A) × P(BJA)
Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events
The probability of two or more mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual
probabilities.

--- Page 268 ---

Le. P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B)
Conditional Probability
Probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
ie.  P(A/B) = P(A and B)/ P(B)
For example:
1. Probability of drawing two Kings (with replacement):
P(King) * P(King) = 1/13 « 1/13= 1/169 = 0,006 (or 0.6%)
Probability of drawing two Kings (without replacement):
P(King) × P(King) = 4/52 3/51 = 3/663 = 0.0045 (or 0.45%)
2. Probability of rolling two 6s: P(6) × P(6) = 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36
3. Probability of drawing a King and then a Queen:
P(King) * P(Queen | King) = (4/52) = (4/51) = 16/2652
Remember to consider the type of events and their relationships when calculating the probability
of combined events.
Probability of Combined Events using Sample Space Diagrams
A sample space diagram is a visual representation of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
It can be used to calculate the probability of combined events by identifying the favorable
outcomes and dividing them by the total number of possible outcomes.
To calculate the probability of combined events using a sample space diagram:
« Draw a sample space diagram showing all possible outcomes of the experiment.
« Identify the favorable outcomes that meet the conditions of the combined event.
« Count the number of favorable outcomes.
e Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes in the
sample space.
Example:
What is the probability that both coin A and coin B land heads up if both coins are flipped
simultaneously² Solution: a | = : Say
Favorable Outcomes: hH (both coins land heads up) i
Number of Favorable Outcomes: 1 | |
Total Number of Possible Outcomes: 4 | | | |
Probability: ¼ or 0.25 | |
This means that the probability of both coins landing —_| | | | |
heads up is ¼ or 25%. | | ane
Probability of Combined Events using Diagram
There are several types of sample space diagram, including:
Possibility Diagrams Tree Diagrams Venn Diagrams

--- Page 269 ---

By using an appropriate sample space diagram, we can easily visualize and calculate the
probability of combined events. This method is especially helpful while dealing with
complicated experiments and multiple events.
(a) Probability of Combined Events using Possibility Diagram
Possibility diagram is graphical representation of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
Example:
Raabi and Jerry are hoping on their play circles of four sectors each painted in red, green, yellow
and blue colours.
Find the probability that they will jump on:
(a) At the same colour (b) At the different colours
Solution: We can associate the ordered pair (x, y), where × represents hops of Raabi and y
represents hops of Jerry to show an outcome in the sample space. Here (blue, green): means
Raabi lands on blue while Jerry lands on green.
50 the sample space is:
S = {(red, red), (red, green), (red, yellow), (red, blue), (green, red), (green, green),
(green, yellow), (green, blue), (yellow, red), (yellow, green), (yellow, yellow), (yellow, blue),
(blue, red), (blue, green), (blue, yellow), (blue, blue)} |
Which seems complicated and time taking method of writing sample space for bigger problems.

By using a possibility diagram, we can easily visualize and calculate the probability of combined
events. This method is especially helpful when dealing with sequential experiments and
conditional probability. ,
(b) Probability of Combined Events using Tree Diagram

possible outcomes and their probabilities in the form of:
Root Node (starting point) Branches (representing possible outcomes or decisions)
__ Leaf'Nodes (representing the final outcomes)

(c) Probability of Combined Events using Venn Diagram
A Venn diagram is a pictorial representation of sets and their relationships, using overlapping
‘disjoint circles to represent the intersection of sets. It can be used to calculate the probability of
combined events by identifying the regions that represent the favorable outcomes and calculating
their probabilities.
Example:
Zainab randomly picks a book from a library shelf containing 50 books, as shown in fig:
Find probabilities:
(a) Itis grade7 book (b) _—‘It is an English book U
(c) Itis an English book of grade 7 [ee ~]
Solution: | Grade? PK Grades
(a) The probability of picking a grade 7 book: if \ |

(b) ‘The probability of picking an English book Ne ee 40
(given that it's a grade 7 book): a —
P(Englis book from grade 7 books) = 2/5
(c) To find the probability of picking a book that is both a grade 7 book and an English book,
multiply the above probabilities:
So, the probability of picking a book randomly from the 50 books that is a grade 7 English book
is ½5 or 4%.

By using a Venn diagram, we can easily visualize and calculate the probability of combined
events. This method is especially helpful when dealing with multiple events and their
intersections.
~"~Probability Rules
Addition Rule
The probability of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities.
Multiplication Rule
The probability of two or more events occurring independently is the product of their individual
probabilities.
Complement Rule
The probability of an event not occurring is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.
Addition Rule of Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events
The addition rule of probability states that the probability of two or more mutually exclusive
events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B), | where A and B are mutually exclusive events.
Applying addition rule of probability to problems of rolling even and odd number on a dice
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving even and odd
numbers rolled on a dice by treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events
Example: .
Hajrah rolled a fair cubical dice once. Find the probability of rolling an even or an odd number.
Solution:
On a fair cubical dice, there are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6 and 3 odd numbers: 1,3,5
Since the dice has 6 faces, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.
The probability of rolling an even number or an odd number is: "
P(Even) = 3/6 = ½ and P(Odd) = 3/6 = ½
Since the events are mutually exclusive (a roll can't be both even and odd), we can add the
probabilities:
P(Even or Odd) = P(Even) + P(Odd) = ½ + ½ =1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving left and right hand turns
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving taking left or right
turns, by treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events. |
Example:
Mr. Bilal can make either a left turn (L) or a right turn (R) at an intersection on his journey to
Tiri Mengal. The probabilities of making a left turn and a right turn are:
P(L) = 0.3 (30% ) & P(R) =0.7 (70%). Find the probability of making either a left or a right turn.
Solution: )
Since making a left turn and making a right tum are mutually exclusive events (he can't make

--- Page 272 ---

both at the same time), so
we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of making either a left turn or a right tum:
P(L or R) = P(L) + P(R) = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving tossing a coin
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving tossing a coin by
treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events. .
Example:
Sunayna tossed a fair coin with two outcomes: Heads (H) and Tails (T). The probabilities are:
P(H) = 0.5 (50% chance of getting Heads) and P(T)=0.5 (50% chance of getting Tails)
find the probability of getting either Head or Tail.
Solution:
Since getting Head and getting Tail are mutually exclusive events (the coin can't land on both at
the same time), so
we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of getting either Heads or Tails:
P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving winning or losing
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving winning or losing by
treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events.
Example:
Affan played a game with two possible outcomes L and W such that P(W) = 0.4 (40%) and
P(L) = 0.6 (60%). Find the probability of either winning or losing the game.
Solution:
Since winning and losing are mutually exclusive events (he can't both win and lose at the same
time), we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of either winning or losing:
P(W or L) = P(W) + P(L)=0.4+0.6=1
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Independent and Dependent Events
The multiplication rule of probability states that the probability of two or more events occurring
is the product of their individual probabilities.
(i) For independent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
(ii) For dependent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(BIA); where P(BIA) is the conditional probability of B given A.
Example: (Independent Events)
Haneen flipped a fair coin twice. What is the probability of getting heads both times?
Solution:
P(Heads on first flip)='4 and P(Heads on second flip) = ½
Since the coin flips are independent, we can apply the multiplication rule:
.. P (Heads on both flips) = P(Heads on first flip) × P(Heads on second flip) = ½ × ½= ¼
Example: (Dependent Events)
Zeemal drew 2 cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing two

--- Page 273 ---

spades in a row?
Solution:
P(First card is spade) = 13/52 = ¼ .
P(Second card is spade | First card is spade) = 12/51 |
Since the events.are dependent, we can apply the multiplication rule with conditional probability
P(T wo spades in a row) = P(First card is spade) × P(Second card is spade | First card is spade)
= ¼ × 12/51 = 3/51
Multiplication Rule of Probability Involving Trade
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving trade by
treating the outcomes as independent events.
Example:
Mahmil made 2 trades, as given:
Trade 1: Buying Mangoes (BM) and Trade 2: Selling Berries (SB)
With the probabilities:
Find the probabi'ity of both trades being successful. .
Solution:
Since the trades are independent (the outcome of one trade doesn't affect the other), we can apply
the multiplication rule to find the probability of both trades being successful:
P(BM and SB) = P(BM) * P(SB)= 0.6 × 0.7 = 0.42 Es
This means there is a 42% chance of both trades being successful. |
Multiplication Rule of Probability Involving Flipping a Coin :
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving flipping a coin
by treating the outcomes as independent events.
Example:
Azkaa flipped a biased coin twice with following outcomes:
Flip 1: Heads (H) or Tails (T) and _‘ Flip 2: Heads (H) or Tails (T)
With the probabilities:
P(H)=0.7 nad P(T)=0.3  -Find the probability of:
i.  ° Both heads ii. First head then tail
iii. First tail then head iv. Both tails
Solution: : ,
Since the coin flips are independent (the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the other), we can
apply the multiplication rule to find the probability of specific outcomes:
i, P(HH) = P(H) = P(H) = 0.7 × 0.7=0.49 (49% chance of getting Heads both times)
i," PQHT) = PH) = P(T) = 0.7 = 0,3 = 0.21 (21% chance of getting Heads then Tails)
iii, | P(TH)=P(T) × P(H) = 0.3 × 0.7=0.21 (21% chance of getting Tails then Heads)
iv. P(TT)=P(T)x P(T) =0.3 × 0.3 =0.09 (9 % chance of getting Tails both times)
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Drawing Cards with Replacement
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving drawing 2

--- Page 274 ---

ards with replacement by treating the outcomes as independent events.
{xample:
2omaisa draws 2 cards from standard deck with replacement as given :
‘irstdraw > Any card (52 possibilities)
second draw > Any card (52 possibilities, since the first card is replaced)
‘ind the probabilities of:
i. Both black cards ii. Both hearts
iii. | First spade then heart iv. First Queen of Spades then King of Hearts
solution: so
Since the events are independent (the outcome of the second draw does not depend on the first
jraw), we can apply the multiplication rule to find the probability of specific outcomes:
i. P(Both black cards) = P(black) × P(black) = 26/52 × 26/52 = ¼
il. P(Both hearts) = P(heart) × P(heart) = 13/52 × 13/52 = 1/16
iii. | P(spade then heart) = P(spade) × P(heart) = 13/52 * 13/52 = 1/16
iv.  P(Queen of Spades then King of Hearts)
= P(Queen of Spades) × P(King of Hearts)
= 1/52 « 1/52 = 1/1704
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Drawing Cards without Replacement
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving drawing 2
cards without replacement by treating the outcomes as dependent events.
Example:
Sundas draws 2 cards one after the-other from a standard pack of playing cards, such that:
First draw > Any card (52 possibilities) _
Seconddraw > Any card (51 possibilities, since one card has already been drawn)
then find the probabilities of: |
i. Both black cards ii. Both hearts
iii. | First spade then heart iv. First Queen of Spades then King of Hearts
Solution:
Since the events are dependent we can apply the multiplication rule to find the probability :
i. P(Both black cards) = P(black)  P(black/black) = 26/52°* 25/51 = 25/102
ii. P(Both hearts) = P(heart) × P(heart/heart) = 13/52 x12/31 = 3/51
iii. | P(spade then heart) + P(spade) × P(heart/spade) = 13/52 = 13/51 = 13/204
iv.  P(first Queen of Spades then King of Hearts)
= P(Queen of Spades) × P(King of Hearts/ Queen of Spades) = 1/52 × 1/51 = 1/ 2652

* A table consisting of values of a data along with their frequencies is.called a frequency table.

° In a group data, the table consisting of class intervals and their respective frequencies is called
frequency table or a frequency distribution.

' © The representation of data by a polygon in which class marks are plotted along x-axis and

frequencies along y-axis is called a frequency polygon.

° In a group data, number of values less than or within the limits of a class is called cumulative
frequency of the respective class.

eA polygon made by. joining the points whose x-coordinates are class marks and y-coordinates
are their cumulative frequencies is called a cumulative frequency polygon.

--- Page 276 ---

e An ogive is a smooth curve, while a cumulative frequency polygon is a polygon-shaped
graph made by straight segments.
e The three values which divide the whole data into four equal are called quartiles.
© Deciles divide a dataset or a distribution into 10 equal parts, each representing 10% of the
© Percentiles divide a dataset or a distribution into 100 equal parts, each representing 1% of the
data.
e IQR =Q3—- QI, where IQR represents the spread of the data within the middle half of the
distribution.
e A box-and-whisker plot is a graphical representation of a dataset that displays the distribution
of values through 5 data points: min, max, Qi, Q2, Qs
e A single value which can represent the whole data is called measure of central tendency,
measure of location or an average. ,
© The middle most value of an arranged data is called median average or simply median.
The measures which tell us how the values of a data are scattered around their average, are
called measures of dispersion.
e Range is the difference of largest and smallest values of the data.
e Variance is the ratio between sum of squares of deviations from mean and the number of
values.
« Standard deviation is the positive square root of variance.
+ Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring.
e The percentage ratio between the standard deviation and mean of a data is called coefficient
of variation ie. C.V. == * 100
