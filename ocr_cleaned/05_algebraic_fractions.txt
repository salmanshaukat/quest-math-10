Use of letters to represent an unknown quantity was introduced . |
by “Rene Descartes”, a French Mathematician, in 1637. Today ‘x*
is used by most nations as the standard letter for a single |
unknown. Infect x-rays were so named because the:scientists who db |
discovered them did not know what they were and thus labeled 7. LA o
them the “unknown rays’ or x-rays. Algebra is basically an J
extension of Arithmetic. Se
X-ray ,
A factory worker wants to work overtime to fulfill his
basic necessities of life. The factory owner has decided to -
give him Rs, 60 per hour for working extra, But sometimes “ |
he does not have enough time to work overtime daily. So we
he-cannot find his accurate monthly income for working | ar 2
extra. If we represent overtime of the worker in hours fora Pan a. |
month by an unknown quantity say ‘t’, then we can say ; a |
that his salary for working overtime will be ‘60t’. : Oe

, Algebraic Expressions - .
A statement in which variables or constants or both are connected by arithmetic operations
(i.e. +,-,x,+) is called an algebraic expression.

Kinds of Algebraic Expressions
Algebraic expressions are of three kinds. .- ) '
. Polynomial Expressions —_
° Rational Expressions .
° Irrational Expressions ;
Polynomials are algebraic expressions consisting of one or more terms in which exponents of
the variables involved are non-negative (either zero or positive) integers.
For example: |
0, -2, 2x +3 yz, -fey. √2x* —nx?— 10 ete.
The expressions x~°, yr, a/y* , 2y² are not polynomials because their exponents are
not non negative integers (whole numbers). _
Polynomial with respect to [_ SS

--- Page 99 ---

} (a) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Terms , ns
e A polynomial having one term is called a monomial. e.g., 3, x, 0 etc. ;
« A polynomial having two terms is called a binomial. :
. eg. at+b,2x+y, 7ab— ; » xi+ 2 etc,
¢ A polynomial having three terms is called a trinomial.
e.g. x7+2xy+yp?, ; x+ ax 9 etc.
_ All other polynomials having more than three non- zero terms are called polynomials of four
‘terms, five terms, six terms and so on.
When a polynomial is written in descending order, then the first coefficient is called
the leading coefficient. e.g., in p(x) = 3x‘ — 2x² + 1, the leading coefficient is 3.
Here p(x) means that the variable in the polynomial is ‘x’.
(b) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Degree
> Zero polynomial or no degree polynomial:
“0” is called a polynomial of no degree. Also, 0x² + Ox.is a no degree polynomial,
because coefficients are always zero in zero polynomial. .
> Constant polynomial: '
A polynomial having degree zero is called a constant polynomial. eg. 2,—5, > √5
are all constant polynomials. |
>» Linear polynomial: 4
A polynomial having degree one is called a linear polynomial. e.g., x, 2x-y, — Txy* etc.
| _» Quadratic polynomial: A polynomial having degree two is called a quadratic ;
polynomial. e.g., 2x²+7, ax + 2xy + 3-2 ay" etc, ,
> Cubic polynomial: oo . .
_ A polynomial having degree three is called a cubic polynomial. e.g. 9 -— Tx + 5,
Oxzy, 3x*y — - z ete.
All other polynomials have no specific name w.r.t. degree but simply, we call them
polynomials of degree four, degree five and so on. '
(c) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Coefficients .
~ Polynomials can also be classified according to the coefficients of the variables involved in
each term of them. e.g., —3x² + 4x — 1 is a polynomial with integers co-efficients because
—3,4,-leZ. .

--- Page 100 ---

— a 1 5 9 22, oe 22
_ Similarly, ri yr-ax y+ isa polynomial with real numbers because > —H, = eR.
Just like this we can also check the coefficients in any polynomial and classify it accordingly.
(d) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Variables
Classification of polynomials is also possible with respect to the variables involved in them.
e.g., xy — 7 is a polynomial in two variables × , y. We can express it as
Similarly, 6x°yz + 12 xy*z° + 9z* is a polynomial in three variables × , y, z. We may write it
as Q (x, y , Z) = Gx² yz + 12 xy°z° + 924,
Recall a
The highest exponent of the variable involved in a: polynomial is called its degree. If more
- than one variable are being multiplied in terms of a polynomial. Then the degree of that
polynomial is the sum of exponent ofall the variables present in a term. .
(b) Rational Expression —_.
An algebraic expression of the form th »where P(x)and Q(x) are polynomials and Q(x) # 0
O(x)
(i.e. it is not a zero polynomial) is called a rational expression.

- Reduction of a rational expression is done on the same rules as in reduction of a rational
number. To reduce a rational expression to its lowest form, we have to
e Factorize the numerator and denominator completely.
e Divide the numerator and denominator by their common factors.
¢ Rewrite the remaining terms as a fraction, computing all products. This will be the
reduced form.

are polynomials but Q is not a zero polynomial, is called an irrational expression.

| Evaluation of Algebraic Expressions ©
The process of replacing the variables by numbers in an algebraic expression is called
‘substitution’. The process of getting a numerical answer by substituting numbers for each
variable is called ‘evaluation’. .

Basic Operations on Algebraic Fractions
Operations with rational numbers and rational algebraic expressions are very similar, A
_ ‘ational number can be expressed as the quotient \of two integers. A rational algebraic
expression can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials. In either case, the
denominator can never be 0. .

greatest common factor (GCD). .

Another method for simplifying a complex rational expression involves first adding or
subtracting, as necessary, to get one rational expression in the numerator and one rational
expression in the denominator. The problem is thereby simplified to one involving the
division of two expressions. .

- Solving Rational Equations
An equation that contains one or more rational expressions is called a rational equation. Here
"are some examples:
2, × 1 x-4 6. #x7F a5
S-=s-, 2-04 229
5.4 x: x+lo x-2 x+l x
Equations of this type occur frequently in applications. It is easiest to solve a rational equation ,
if the fractions are eliminated. This can be done by multiplying each side of the equation by
the least common denominator (LCD). Remember that when you multiply each side by the
LCD, each term on each side must be multiplied by the LCD.

in a denominator of zero. When solving rational equations, we check that for solution
denominator should be non-zero. If denominator is zero in any value of x, these values be
excluded from list of solutions.
