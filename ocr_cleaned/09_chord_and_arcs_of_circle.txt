Circle theorems are statements in geometry that state important results related to circles that are
used to solve various questions in geometry. They have very useful applications within design and
engineering.
These theorems show relationships between angles within the geometry of a circle. We can use
these theorems along with prior knowledge of other angle properties to calculate missing angles,
without the use of a protractor. _ ~ ¢

Chords of a Circle
Yelinition :
A line segment joining two points of a circle is called chord of that circle.
Theorem 9.1
Statement: One and only one circle can pass through three non collinear points. .
(i) Take three non-collinear points A,B and C onthe paper eS
and join them to obtain the triangle. vo ai \ oN
(ii) Draw right bisectors of the sides, They will meet at only / i \ ye *
one point P (say). i ewe A!
(iii) With centre P, draw a circle of radius PA. ‘ roe Fj
What do you notice? Does the circle pass through B Ay cE _ “Vg .
and C also? . “Shee, ot -
Corollarjes; (j) One and only one-circle can pass through two points lying on the
same line.
(ii) Two circles cannot intersect each other at more than two points.

Construct a square with sides 6 cm long. Show that one and only one circle can be drawn
through vertices of the square. Measure the radius of the circle.
(i) Construct‘a square ABCD having side equal to 6 cm long. i a Ar
(ii) Draw diagonals AC and BD. if ‘
(iii) The two diagonals bisect each other at point O. : \ A | 6cm ss!
(iv) With centre O, construct a circle with radius OA. \ AO. '
(v) You will see that the circle will also pass through ‘ ff if N\ | /
vertices B, C and D, ‘| é —_ — SL’
As diagonals AC and BD bisect each other. Therefore: “ Fm weet 8
Furthermore, there is only one centre O of the circle, therefore we can say that ,
only one circle can be drawn through vertices of the square.
Now in right triangle ABC:
(ACY = (ABY’ + (BC? Pec]
(ACY = (6)? + (6)? = 36 + 36 = 72 Wtf rae aheca. eeiacada
Taking square root on both sides, we have: ici ne cekene sees Had
AC ~ v72 = 6v2 wn each other, eae
Radius = OA = half of AC = 3√2 cm |

. Theorem 9.2
A straight line drawn from the centre ofa circle to bisect the chord is
perpendicular to the chord. |
(i) Draw achord AB of a circle with centre O. f “ \
(ii) Take a point C on the chord such that AC = BC. |
(iii) Join O to C and measure ZOCA and ZOCB. ‘s /
Are the angles equal? Yes! they are. . 5
» ZOCA=Z0CB i, OC LAB
(i) If a diameter or radial segment of a circle bisects the chord, it is perpendicular to the
chord.
(ii) The diameter or radial segment of a circle passes through the mid points of two parralle]
chords of a circle;
Theorem 9.3
Statement: Perpendicular drawn from the centre of a circle on a chord, bisects it.
Class Activity: - .

(ii) Take a point C on the chord such that ZOCA = 90°. | .
(iii) Measure AC and BC, a /
Are they equal? ANC _B
Yes! they are. i.c., AC =BC
(i) Ifa diameter of a circle is perpendicular to the chord, it bisects the chord.
(ii) Perpendicular (right) bisector of a chord of a circle passes through the centre of a circle.
Example: , :
Diameter and chord of a circle are 20 cm and 16 cm long respectively and are perpendicular
to each other. Calculate the distance of chord form the centre. 6
Solution: so, ow oG
Diameter = CD = 20cm f . \
Radius =OA=10cm
Chord = AB = 16 cm L “|
As the diameter and chord are perpendicular to each other. \e CL /
Therefore, diameter bisects the chord. AN EU ®
Hence, AE=BE=8 cm . Cc
Now in right triangle AEO: |
(AE)? + (OEY =(OA)? = (8)? + (OE) = (10) Diameters of a circle bisect
= (OE) = (10)? - (8) = 100 - 64 = 36 each other.
=> OF=√736=6cm

they are equidistant from the centre as shown in ch£— ~\
the adjoining figure.
(ii): Measure chords AB and CD. | ae ie |

Corollary:
_ (i) Iftwo chords of a circle are unequal, then longer chord is nearer to the centre and vice
versa,
(ii) Iftwo chords of two congruent circles are congruent, then they are equidistant from their
respective centres and vice versa. ee
Example: W7 re
In the adjoining figure, AB || CD such that AB = 24 cm and f “
CD = 10 cm. Find the radius of the circle if distance between Pe
chords is 17 cm. : \ f /
Solution: YS vA
Let the radius of circle be r cm with centre P. cS
Draw PE 1 AB and PF 1
=> BE=5AB and CF=>CD
As the chords AB and CD are parallel, therefore points E, P and Fare collinear and
EF = 17 cm :
Let PE = x, then PF = 17-x
JoinP to BandC,thenPB=PC=r .
Now, PBE and PCF are right angled triangled. Therefore: :
(PB)? = (PE)? + (EB)? and (PC) = (PF)? + (FC)
Poax'+12?? ......@0 and rr =(17-xP +5? ......(ii)
= +12? = (17-xP +5? ..... [comparing (i) and (ii)]
=> x24+144 = 2894+37-34x425 .
=> 34x = 170 "If AB is chord and diameter CD is right
_ = × = 5 bisector of AB, then:
Now from (i), we have: AC=BC and AD=BD
| ni: Chontand Ares aCe 20 Naonl Book Foundation |

P =S4+12? =25 + 144 = 169
Taking square roots on both sides, we get r= 13. ‘
“. Radius of circle = r= 13 cm
Example: -
Two parallel chords AB and CD of lengths 16 cmand 12cm = a _E_ 8
respectively are drawn on the opposite sides of centre O of fos, + \
the circle. Find the distance between the chords if the radius SS lO |
of the circle is 10 cm. / 7 |
Solution: \ Fi | /
Radius of circle = OA = OC = 10 cm Panama
AB = l6cm, CD = 12 cm
Draw OE 1 AB and OF 1 CD ,
= AE=+AB=8cm and CF=>CD=6em
As AB || CD, therefore points E, O and F are collinear.
Now, OAE and OCF are right angled triangles. Therefore:
(OEY + (AEP =(OAY and (OF + (CFY = (OC)
= (OE) +(8%=(10) and (OF) + (6)? = (10Y
= (OE) +64=100 aid (OF)? + 36 = 100
Taking square roots, we get:
OE=6cm and OF =8 cm

A diameter divides a circle into two equal parts. Each part is called fo™
semicircle or half circle. We use three letters to name a semicircle. /
The first and third letter are end points of diameter. × P -
In the figure, XAY is semicircle. Can you name the other semicircle?
Minor and Major arcs .

(i) Major arc of a.circle and semicircle arc denoted by three letters.
(ii) | Minor arc is less than and major arc is greater than the semicircle.
Central Angle
Angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is called
central angle of the arc. An angle whose vertex is the a ™
centre of circle and whose arms pass through end points / \
of arc is known as central angle of arc. or
-If an arc is included in a semi-circle, then its central Nf
angle is less than 180°. Central angle of semi-circle A |
is straight angle (180°). Central angle of major arc
of the circle is greater than 180°.
In the figure ZAOB is central angle.
Congruent Arcs |
Two arcs of a circle (or of two congruent circles) are congruent if their central angles are
congruent. :

1. Solving the problems by using the properties of a circle that: |
¢: One and only one circle can pass through three non collinear points.
* A straight line drawn from the centre of a circle to bisect the chord is perpendicular to:
the chord arid vice versa.
¢ Two congruent chords of a circle are equidistant from the centre and vice versa.
* Iftwo arcs of a circle (or of congruent circles) are congruent, then the corresponding _
chords are equal and vice versa. |
. . Equal chords of a circle (or of congruent circles) subtend equal angles at the centre (at
the corresponding centres) and vice versa.
¢ Applying concepts of chords and arcs to real life word problems such as decorative
features, rainbow, bridges and roller coaster track. .
