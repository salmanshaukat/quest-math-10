3. (a) (1/2)ab sinC
4. (b) -cos(theta)
5. (a) R = a/(2 sinA)

### Section B
**Q6.** sin150 = sin30 = **1/2**. cos150 = -cos30 = **-sqrt(3)/2**. tan150 = -tan30 = **-1/sqrt(3)**

**Q7.** a = sqrt(144+25) = **13 cm**. angle B = arctan(12/5) = **67.4 degrees** (approx).

**Q8.** c^2 = 49+64-2(7)(8)cos60 = 113-56 = 57. **c = sqrt(57) = 7.55** (approx).

**Q9.** Area = (1/2)(5)(7)sin30 = (1/2)(35)(1/2) = **8.75 cm^2**

**Q10.** R = a/(2sinA) = 10/(2sin45) = 10/(2*sqrt(2)/2) = 10/sqrt(2) = **5*sqrt(2) = 7.07** (approx).

### Section C

## ANSWER KEY — TEST 9: Chords and Arcs of a Circle

### Section A (MCQs)
1. (c) Chord
2. (b) Bisects the chord
3. (c) Equal
4. (a) l = r * theta
5. (a) (1/2) r^2 theta

### Section B
**Q6.** Half-chord = sqrt(100-36) = sqrt(64) = 8. **AB = 16 cm**

**Q7.** Given: OC perpendicular to AB, OD perpendicular to CD, AB = CD. Using congruent right triangles (HL), OC = OD. **Equal chords are equidistant from centre.**

**Q8.** l = r*theta = 14*(60*pi/180) = 14*(pi/3) = **14pi/3 = 14.66 cm**

**Q9.** A = (1/2)r^2*theta = (1/2)(49)(pi/2) = **49pi/4 = 38.48 cm^2**

**Q10.** Distance of CD from centre = **5 cm** (same as AB, since equal chords are equidistant from centre — Theorem 9.5).

### Section C
**Q11.** (a) Proof: Let M be midpoint of AB. In triangles OMA and OMB: OA = OB (radii), MA = MB (M is midpoint), OM = OM (common). By SSS, triangle OMA = triangle OMB. Therefore angle OMA = angle OMB = 90 degrees.
(b) Half-chord = sqrt(169-25) = sqrt(144) = 12. **Chord = 24 cm**.

**Q12.** (a) Half-chord = 30. Distance = sqrt(2500-900) = sqrt(1600) = **40 m**.
(b) sin(theta/2) = 30/50 = 0.6, theta/2 = 36.87, theta = 73.74 degrees = 1.287 radians. Area = (1/2)(2500)(1.287) = **1608.75 m^2** (approx).

## ANSWER KEY — TEST 10: Tangents and Angles of a Circle

### Section A (MCQs)
1. (b) Perpendicular
2. (c) Half
3. (c) Right angle
4. (c) Supplementary
5. (c) Equal in length

### Section B
**Q6.** PT = sqrt(OP^2-OT^2) = sqrt(169-25) = sqrt(144) = **12 cm**

**Q7.** Inscribed angle ACB = (1/2)(central angle AOB) = (1/2)(120) = **60 degrees**

**Q8.** Let angle ACB be inscribed in semicircle where AB is diameter. Arc AB = 180 degrees. Central angle = 180 degrees. Inscribed angle = 180/2 = **90 degrees**.

**Q9.** angle C = 180-75 = **105 degrees**. angle D = 180-110 = **70 degrees**.

**Q10.** Inscribed angle = 100/2 = **50 degrees**. Angle in major segment = (360-100)/2 = **130 degrees**.

### Section C
**Q11.** Proof by contradiction: Assume tangent is not perpendicular to radius. Then there exists a shorter distance from centre to the line, meaning the line intersects the circle at two points — contradicting the definition of tangent. Therefore the tangent must be perpendicular to the radius.

**Q12.** (a) Distance = 8+5 = **13 cm**. (b) Direct common tangent = sqrt(d^2-(r1-r2)^2) = sqrt(169-9) = sqrt(160) = **4*sqrt(10) = 12.65 cm**. (c) Transverse common tangent = sqrt(d^2-(r1+r2)^2) = sqrt(169-169) = **0 cm** (the circles touch, so transverse tangent has zero length at the point of tangency).
