Graphs of Some Algebraic Functions

Polynomial Functions

A function f : R → R defined as f(x) = a₀ + a₁x + a₂x² + a₃x³ + ... + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + aₙxⁿ, where a₀, a₁, a₂, a₃, ..., aₙ₋₁, aₙ are all real numbers and n (called the degree of polynomial) is a non-negative integer is called a polynomial function.

For example, f(x) = 2x³ − x² + x is a polynomial function of degree 3 having leading coefficient 2.

Key Facts:
- The highest exponent of the variable involved in a polynomial is called its degree.
- The coefficient of highest degree term in a polynomial is called the leading coefficient.

(i) Zero Polynomial Function

A polynomial function of no degree is called a zero polynomial function. This function is of the form:

Have You Noticed?

- The graph of f(x) = 1/x has two branches.
- The graph of y = 1/x exists in the first and third quadrants only.
- As x → ∞, f(x) → 0 from above.
- As x → −∞, f(x) → 0 from below.
- As x → 0 from the right, f(x) → ∞.
- As x → 0 from the left, f(x) → −∞.

Enlighten Yourself:
The symbol ∞ was first used by John Wallis in 1655 which means unbounded.

Example:
Sketch the graph of y = 1/(x − 2).

Solution:
y-intercept: y = 1/(0 − 2) = −0.5
As x → ∞, y → 0
As x → −∞, y → 0

Example:
Saim can jog 4 miles downhill in the same time which he takes to jog 2 miles uphill. He takes downhill 3mph faster than he jogs uphill. Find his jogging rate uphill and downhill.

Solution:
Let his uphill rate = x
Then, his downhill rate = x + 3
Uphill time = 2/x
Downhill time = 4/(x + 3)

According to the given condition,
downhill time = uphill time
4/(x + 3) = 2/x
⇒ 4x = 2(x + 3)
⇒ 4x = 2x + 6 ⇒ 4x − 2x = 6 ⇒ x = 3

Thus, his uphill rate = 3mph and his downhill rate = 3 + 3 = 6mph

DIAGRAM: There are two diagrams on this page.

1. Graph of y = 1/(x − 2): A coordinate plane showing the graph of the reciprocal function y = 1/(x − 2). The graph has two branches (hyperbola). The left branch is in the region x < 2, curving downward from the negative y-axis region and approaching the vertical asymptote at x = 2 from the left. The right branch is in the region x > 2, emerging from above near the vertical asymptote at x = 2 and curving toward the x-axis as x increases. The graph has a vertical asymptote at x = 2 (shown as a dashed vertical line) and a horizontal asymptote at y = 0 (the x-axis). The y-intercept is marked at (0, −0.5). The axes are labeled with tick marks and the curve approaches but never touches either asymptote.

Solution of a Linear and a Quadratic Equation Graphically

As we know that the graph of a linear equation is a straight line and of a quadratic equation is a curve. The point of intersection of these two graphs is a point where both the graphs intersect each other.

Example:
Solve f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = x² − x + 3 graphically.

Solution:
Table of values for f(x) = 2x + 1

| x    | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 | 3 |
|------|-----|-----|---|---|---|
| f(x) | −3  | −1  | 1 | 3 | 7 |

For the graph of g(x) = x² − x + 3, we compare it with y = ax² + bx + c, we have:
a = 1, b = −1 and c = 3.

Here, a = 1 > 0, so the curve will open upward.

Also h = −b/(2a) = −(−1)/(2(1)) = 1/2 = 0.5

and k = c − b²/(4a) = 3 − (−1)²/(4(1)) = 3 − 1/4 = 2.75

So, the vertex of parabola is (h, k) = (0.5, 2.75).

Table of values for g(x) = x² − x + 3

| x    | −1 | 0 | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|------|-----|---|-----|---|---|---|
| g(x) | 5   | 3 | 2.75| 3 | 5 | 9 |

Both the graphs intersect each other at:
(1, 3) and (2, 5).

Hence, solution set = {(1, 3) and (2, 5)}

---
DIAGRAM: The page contains a large coordinate plane graph showing the graphical solution of the simultaneous linear and quadratic equations. The graph includes:

1. A straight line representing f(x) = 2x + 1, drawn from the lower-left to the upper-right of the coordinate plane, passing through points such as (−2, −3), (0, 1), (1, 3), and (2, 5).

2. A parabola (U-shaped curve opening upward) representing g(x) = x² − x + 3. The vertex of the parabola is at (0.5, 2.75), and it passes through points (−1, 5), (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 5), and (3, 9).

3. The two graphs intersect at exactly two points, which are clearly labeled:
   - (1, 3) — where both the line and parabola meet
   - (2, 5) — the second intersection point

4. The vertex point (0.5, 2.75) is also marked on the parabola.

The x-axis extends from approximately −3 to beyond 3, and the y-axis extends from below −4 to above 8. Grid lines are visible. Both axes are labeled with x' and y' at their negative ends and x and y at their positive ends. The intersection points are emphasized to show the solution set of the system of equations.

Introduction of Vectors

There are two main types of physical quantities used in Physics, Mathematics and Engineering. They are known as, 'scalars' and 'vectors'.

Scalar
A physical quantity that possesses magnitude only, is called a scalar quantity. It can be completely specified by a number along with unit. For example, mass, time, speed, density, work, distance, length, perimeter, area, volume, etc.

Vector
A physical quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction, is called a vector quantity. For example, weight, displacement, momentum, force, velocity, acceleration, electric field etc.

Scalar and Vector

Class Activity:
Look at the table below and categorize the quantities as scalar or vector.

| S. No | Quantity          | Category |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| 1     | 7 m               |          |
| 2     | 40 m/sec, West    |          |
| 3     | 144 square metre  |          |
| 4     | 32 °C             |          |
| 5     | 98 Newtons        |          |
| 6     | 6540 Calories     |          |
| 7     | 5 km, East        |          |

Geometrical Representation of a Vector
Geometrically a vector is represented by a line segment with an arrow head at its one end (the ray). The length of the line segment describes the magnitude and the arrow head indicates the direction of the vector.

DIAGRAM: There are three diagrams/illustrations on this page.

1. Scalar and Vector illustration (top-right area): Two side-by-side images comparing scalar and vector quantities.
   - Left image (Scalar): Shows a person walking, with the label "Speed: 10 km/h" and an annotation showing "y distance" on the vertical axis. This represents a scalar quantity (speed) which has magnitude only.
   - Right image (Vector): Shows a similar scene with the label "10 km/h" and annotations showing "y distance" on the vertical axis and "x distance" on the horizontal axis. An arrow indicates direction. Below it states: "Velocity is vector which means direction is also included." This represents a vector quantity (velocity) which has both magnitude and direction.

2. Geometrical Representation of a Vector (bottom-right): A directed line segment (arrow) drawn from point A (labeled as "tail") at the bottom to point B (labeled as "head") at the top. The arrow points upward from A to B, illustrating how a vector is represented geometrically as a ray with a tail (initial point) and head (terminal point) marked with an arrowhead.
