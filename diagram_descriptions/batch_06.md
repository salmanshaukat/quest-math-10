triangle ABC, then from the figure:
area of triangle ABC = area of triangle IBC + area of triangle IAC + area of triangle IAB

Delta = (1/2) x BC x ID + (1/2) x AC x IE + (1/2) x AB x IF

Delta = (1/2) x a x r + (1/2) x b x r + (1/2) x c x r = (1/2) x r x (a + b + c)

Delta = (r x (a + b + c)) / 2 = rS

r = Delta / S

--- Key Facts ---
The two geometrical figures, circle and triangle are made up of distinct conception. The triangle is made with straight lines, whereas circle is made by curve lines (arcs). The beauty of circum-circle and in-circle of a triangle is a combination of a triangle and a circle. Engineers use this combination in making parts of machines.

E-Radius of a Circle of a Triangle

Consider a triangle ABC. Draw internal bisector of angle A and external bisectors of angle B and angle C of triangle intersecting at I_1 which is the centre of ex-circle.

By drawing angle bisectors, the given triangle ABC has been divided into three triangles I_1AB, I_1BC and I_1AC.

Draw altitude I_1D of triangle I_1AB, altitude I_1E of triangle I_1BC and altitude I_1F of triangle I_1AC. Note that
I_1D = I_1E = I_1F = radius of e-circle = r_1

Now if AB = c, BC = a, AC = b and Delta is the area of triangle ABC, then from the figure:
area of triangle ABC = area of triangle I_1AB + area of triangle I_1AC - area of triangle I_1BC

Delta = (1/2) x AB x I_1D + (1/2) x AC x I_1F - (1/2) x BC x I_1E

Delta = (1/2) x c x r_1 + (1/2) x b x r_1 - (1/2) x a x r_1 = (1/2) x r_1 x (c + b - a)

Delta = r_1 x (2S - 2a) / 2 = r_1(S - a)

r_1 = Delta / (S - a)

Similarly, we can prove that:

r_2 = Delta / (S - b)   and   r_3 = Delta / (S - c)

DIAGRAM: The page contains two diagrams:

1. (Top of page, continuing from previous page) A triangle ABC with an inscribed circle (incircle). The incircle has center I and touches side BC at D, side AC at E, and side AB at F. The perpendicular distances from I to each side (ID, IE, IF) represent the inradius r. The sides are labeled: BC = a, AC = b, AB = c.

2. (Bottom half of page) A triangle ABC with an escribed circle (ex-circle) opposite to vertex A. The ex-circle has center I_1 and is drawn outside the triangle, tangent to side BC externally and to the extensions of sides AB and AC. Points D, E, and F mark where the ex-circle touches the lines containing BC, AB, and AC respectively. Internal bisector of angle A and external bisectors of angles B and C are shown meeting at I_1. The vertices are labeled A at bottom-left, B at bottom-right, and C at right. The ex-circle center I_1 is positioned to the right of the triangle, with dashed lines showing the altitudes I_1D, I_1E, and I_1F from I_1 to the respective sides/extensions. Additional labels show points D and E on or near side BC, and F near side AC.

Step 2: Sketching and labeling the second right triangle EAC using information from step 1.

            E
           /|
     12cm / | x cm
         /  |
        A---C
        22.63cm

Step 3: EAC is a right-angled triangle, so we can use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the length of EC.

Let EC = x cm
x^2 = (12)^2 + (22.63)^2
x^2 = 144 + 512.12 = 656.12
Taking square root on both sides, we get:
x = sqrt(656.12) = 25.61
Therefore, EC = 25.61 cm

Example: ABCDEF is an isosceles triangular prism.
BC is 8cm, angle DFE = 70° and angle FCD = 45°. Find CD.
Solution:
To find CD, we are required DF.
Therefore, first consider triangle DEF to find DF.

In right triangle DGF:
cos 70° = 4 / DF
=> DF = 4 / cos 70° = 11.695 cm

Now in right triangle CFD:
sin 45° = 11.695 / CD
=> CD = 11.695 / sin 45°
= 16.54 cm

3. (Bottom-left) A separate right triangle DGF extracted from the prism, showing the right angle at G. The side from G to F is 4 cm (half of BC = 8 cm), the angle at F is 70°, and DF is the hypotenuse. Point G is the midpoint of EF or the foot of the altitude from D.

4. (Bottom-right) A separate right triangle CFD showing angle 45° at C, with DF = 11.695 cm as the side opposite to C, and CD as the hypotenuse to be found.

Dimensions are marked: the edge from D to C is 12 cm (length), the edge from C to G is 10 cm (height), and the edge from A to E or equivalent is 9 cm (width/depth). The problem asks to find angle ACF, which involves the diagonal AC on the bottom face and the edge CF going up.

DIAGRAM: The page contains one diagram at the bottom:

A parallelogram PQRS is shown with vertices labeled P (bottom-left), Q (bottom-right), R (top-right), and S (top-left). The two diagonals PR and SQ are drawn, intersecting at point T in the center. The diagonal segments are labeled: from P to T is 6, from T to R is 6 (so PR = 12 cm total — this is half of 12, so each half is 6), and from S to T is 11, from T to Q is 11 (so SQ = 22 cm total — each half is 11). The angle at the intersection point T between the diagonals is marked as 143°. The parallelogram sides PQ, QR, RS, and SP are drawn, with the longer sides to be determined.

DIAGRAM: The page contains two diagrams:

1. (Question 17) A geometric figure showing a triangle or quadrilateral. Point B is at the top-left, point C is at the top-right. A line descends from B at an angle of 7° from the vertical, meeting point A to the left and point D directly below B. The distance BD (or AD) is labeled 12.6 cm. The distance BC (horizontal, at the top) connects B to C, and the vertical side from C downward is 22.5 cm. The angle at A (or near A/D) is 7°. The task is to find angle C. The figure appears to show a right-angled shape with B at top-left, C at top-right, and vertical/horizontal measurements, with a slanted line from A to B making a 7° angle with the vertical line BD where BD = 12.6 cm.

2. (Question 18) A square prism (rectangular prism/cuboid) is drawn in 3D perspective. The bottom face has vertices A (front-left), B (front-right), C (back-right), D (back-left). The top face has vertices E (front-left), F (front-right), G (back-left), H (back-right). The base edge AB = 12 cm. The vertical edges (AE, BF, etc.) = 5 cm. The depth edges (AD, BC, etc.) = 5 cm. A diagonal line is drawn from vertex A to vertex G (or similar), and the angle alpha is marked at vertex A between the base edge and this diagonal. The angle alpha is to be determined.
