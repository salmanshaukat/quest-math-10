DIAGRAM: In question 4, there is a triangle OAB. The vertex B is at the top, and O and A are at the bottom-left and bottom-right respectively. Point M is marked on the side OA between O and A, indicating it is the midpoint of OA. The sides are labeled: OA = a (vector from O to A along the base), OB = b (vector from O to B going up-left). Lines connect B to both O and A forming the triangle, and a dashed or implied line connects B to M.

After studying this unit students will be able to:
- Extend sine and cosine functions to angles between 90° and 180°.
- Solve problems using laws of sines, cosines and the area formula for any triangle.
- Solve simple trigonometric problems in three dimensions.
- Apply concepts of trigonometry to real life world problems such as video games, flight engineering, navigation and sound waves.

Burj Khalifa at Dubai is the tallest building in the world with tallest free-standing structure and
highest number of stories. It is 828 metres (2,716.5 feet) high and consists of more than 160
stories. How do scientists know its true height? A common way to measure the height involves
determining the angle of elevation, which is formed by the top of building and the ground at a
point some distance away from the base of the building. This method is much more practical
than climbing the building and dropping a very long tape measure or rope.

DIAGRAM: The page contains a large photograph of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai. The building is shown from a low-angle perspective, rising dramatically against a hazy sky. The tower's distinctive stepped, tapering form is clearly visible with its reflective glass facade. The surrounding shorter buildings and urban landscape of Dubai are visible at the base. This is a real photograph, not a geometric diagram.

Using the properties of angles,
   ∠X = 25° and ∠Y = 50°

In right ΔXUZ,
   tan 25° = ZU / XU
   XU = ZU / tan 25° = 1500 / 0.466 = 3216.76m

In right ΔYUZ,
   tan 50° = ZU / YU
   YU = ZU / tan 50° = 1500 / 1.192 = 1258.65m

∴ Distance between the boats = XY = XU + UY
   = 3216.76 + 1258.65 = 4475.41 m

Example:
Find the measure of ∠F in the adjoining figure.

Solution:
To find ∠F, we need measure of GE.
In right ΔDEG,
   sin 34° = GE / GD
   GE = GD × sin 34° = 14.4 × 0.559 = 8.05cm

Now in right ΔEGF,
   sin(∠F) = GE / GD = 8.05 / 9.6 = 0.839
   ∠F = sin⁻¹(0.839) = 57°2'

Check Point:

DIAGRAM: There are multiple diagrams on this page:

1. Top-right diagram: A triangle showing two boats X and Y on a horizontal line (water surface) with a plane Z above at point U (the foot of the altitude from Z). Z is at the top with altitude ZU = 1500m drawn vertically down to point U on line XY. Angles of depression are marked: 25° at X and 50° at Y. The angle at Z is split into 25° (left) and 50° (right) by the vertical line ZU.

Line segment GE is vertical (perpendicular), and GF = 9.6 cm extends to the right. The figure forms two right triangles: ΔDEG (with right angle at G) and ΔEGF (with right angle at G).

3. Bottom of page - Exercise 8.2, Question 1 has three right-angled triangles:

∴ 2cos² α/2 = 2S × 2(S − a) / 2bc

   cos² α/2 = S(S − a) / bc

   cos α/2 = √(S(S − a) / bc)

Similarly, it can be proved that:
   cos β/2 = √(S(S − b) / ac)   and   cos γ/2 = √(S(S − c) / ab)

(b) Sines of Half Angle
Statement: In any triangle ABC with usual notations,

   sin α/2 = √((S − b)(S − c) / bc),   sin β/2 = √((S − a)(S − c) / ac),   sin γ/2 = √((S − a)(S − b) / ab)

where S = (a + b + c) / 2.

Proof: We know that
   cos α = (b² + c² − a²) / 2bc

   1 − 2sin² α/2 = (b² + c² − a²) / 2bc

   ⇒ 2sin² α/2 = 1 − (b² + c² − a²) / 2bc = (2bc − b² − c² + a²) / 2bc

   ⇒ 2sin² α/2 = (a² − (b − c)²) / 2bc = (a − b + c)(a + b − c) / 2bc

As a + b + c = 2S ⇒ a + c − b = 2S − 2b = 2(S − b) and a + b − c = 2S − 2c = 2(S − c)

∴ 2sin² α/2 = 2(S − b) × 2(S − c) / 2bc

   sin² α/2 = (S − b)(S − c) / bc

   sin α/2 = √((S − b)(S − c) / bc)

Similarly, it can be proved that:
   sin β/2 = √((S − a)(S − c) / ac)   and   sin γ/2 = √((S − a)(S − b) / ab)

Check Point:
Find the diameter of the circle shown in the figure below.

Prove that
   cos γ/2 = √(S(S − c) / ab)   and   sin γ/2 = √((S − a)(S − b) / ab)

Statement: In any triangle ABC with usual notations,

DIAGRAM: There is a small "Check Point" diagram in the upper-right area of the page. It shows a circle with an inscribed triangle. Inside the circle, a chord labeled "k₃" is drawn, and there is an angle of 110° marked at one vertex of the inscribed triangle. The problem asks to find the diameter of the circle. The triangle appears to be inscribed in the circle with one angle measuring 110°.

   [Illustrations of Circumcircle, Incircle, and Escribed circle]

Key Facts:
(i)   Circumcentre is the point of intersection of right bisectors of sides of a triangle.
(ii)  Incentre is the point of intersection of angle bisectors of a triangle.
(iii) E-centre is the point of intersection of one internal bisector of angle and
      external bisectors of remaining angles of a triangle.

Circum-Radius of Circle In-terms of Side and Opposite Angle of Triangle

Let O be the circumcentre of triangle ABC. Draw a diameter BD. Also join C to D.

   (i)                    (ii)                   (iii)

Case-1: When α is Acute
In figure (i), α and ∠BDC are angles in the same segment associated with chord BC.
∴ ∠BDC = α

Now in right angled triangle BCD,
   BC/BD = sin(∠BDC) = sin α
   a/2R = sin α  ⇒  R = a/(2sin α)   where BD = 2R and BC = a.

Case-2: When α is Obtuse
In figure (ii), α + ∠BDC = 180° because ABDC is a cyclic quadrilateral.
∴ ∠BDC = π − α

DIAGRAM: There are multiple diagrams on this page:

1. Top-left: Three diagrams in a row showing circles associated with triangles:
   - Circumcircle: A circle passing through all three vertices of a triangle ABC, with centre O marked inside the triangle and radius R shown.
   - Incircle: A circle drawn inside a triangle ABC, touching all three sides. The centre I is marked inside the triangle, and radius r is shown from the centre to a side.
   - Escribed circle (e-circle): A circle drawn outside the triangle, touching one side (say BC) externally and the extensions of the other two sides. The centre I₁ is outside the triangle, and radius r₁ is shown.

2. Top-right corner: A small illustration showing a triangle with an escribed circle touching one side externally.

3. Middle section - Three figures labeled (i), (ii), (iii) showing circumcircle configurations:
   - Figure (i) - "α is Acute": A circle with centre O, diameter BD drawn vertically. Points B (bottom) and D (top) are endpoints of the diameter. Point C is on the circle. Triangle BCD is drawn with the right angle at C (angle in semicircle). Point A is also on the circle, and angle α is marked at A. The chord BC = a is shown.
   - Figure (ii) - "α is Obtuse": Similar circle with centre O and diameter BD. Points B, C, D are on the circle. Here, A is positioned so that angle α at A is obtuse. The angle ∠BDC is supplementary to α. Triangle BCD is shown inside the circle.
   - Figure (iii) - "α is Right": A circle with diameter BC (since α = 90°, B and C are endpoints of a diameter). Point D is on the circle. The configuration shows that when α is a right angle, BC equals the diameter 2R.
