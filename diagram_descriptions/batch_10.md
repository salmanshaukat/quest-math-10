DIAGRAM 1 (Question 11 - Pulleys): Two circles of different sizes representing pulleys are shown connected by a belt/rope. The smaller pulley is on the left and the larger pulley is on the right. The pulleys are drawn as circles with internal spoke-like structures (resembling mechanical pulleys with six spokes radiating from the centre). The rope wraps around both pulleys forming a closed belt system with two tangent lines connecting the outer edges of the pulleys (one on top, one on bottom).

DIAGRAM 2 (Question 12 - Satellite): An illustration of the Earth shown as a globe with continental outlines visible. A point P is marked on the surface of the Earth (on the left side). A point A is marked above the Earth (to the upper right), representing the satellite. Two tangent lines are drawn from point A to the surface of the Earth, one touching at point P and another touching at a point on the opposite side, indicating the line-of-sight distance from the satellite to the city.

DIAGRAM 3 (Question 13 - Cylindrical Rods): Two circles of equal size (each with diameter 12 cm) are shown side by side, touching each other externally. They are enclosed within an oval/rounded strap that wraps tightly around both circles. The diameter "12 cm" is labelled inside each circle. The strap forms a shape that follows the outer contour of both cylinders, consisting of two semicircular arcs and two straight tangent segments.

DIAGRAM (Question 14 - Circular Mirror): A circle representing the mirror is drawn with radius 20 cm. A point labelled "Hook" is located above the circle. Two straight lines (representing the wire) extend from the Hook downward to points on the left and right sides of the circle, where they are tangent to the circle. The left wire segment is labelled "15 cm" and the right wire segment is labelled "15 cm" (each half of the 30 cm wire). Two radii are drawn from the centre of the circle to the tangent points, each labelled "20 cm". The diagram forms a triangle-like shape with the hook at the apex and the two tangent points on the circle forming the base region.

DIAGRAM (Exercise 7.1, Question 1): Four vector diagrams are shown on Cartesian coordinate planes:

(i) A vector of magnitude 10 N pointing in the North direction (upward along or near the y-axis). The x-axis is labelled with "220 in" and the direction "North" is indicated. The vector arrow starts near the origin and points upward.

(ii) A vector of magnitude 50 m/s drawn from the origin area, making an angle of 150 degrees measured from the positive x-axis (i.e., in the second quadrant). The y-axis is shown vertically and the x-axis horizontally. The vector arrow points to the upper-left region.

(iii) A vector pointing in the "East" direction (along the positive x-axis). The y-axis is vertical and x-axis is horizontal with "East" labelled along the x-axis direction.

(iv) A vector of magnitude 50 m/s^2 making an angle of 45 degrees with the positive x-axis, drawn in the first quadrant. The vector arrow points diagonally upward to the right from the origin.

DIAGRAM (Exercise 7.1, Question 2): Five vector diagrams arranged in a row, each showing a vector at 45 degrees to the positive x-axis (in the first quadrant). Each diagram has the y-axis vertical and x-axis horizontal. The vectors have different magnitudes:
- (i) magnitude p at 45 degrees
- (ii) magnitude 2p at 45 degrees
- (iii) magnitude p at 45 degrees
- (iv) magnitude 0.5p at 45 degrees
- (v) magnitude 1.5p at 45 degrees
All vectors originate from or near the origin and point upward-right at 45 degrees. The x-axis continues as a common baseline for all five sub-diagrams.
