Arcs of Circles

Arc of a Circle
An arc is a part of a circle. In the figure, AB is an arc of the circle P.
Arc AB is denoted by AB (with arc symbol).

Key Fact:
There is a difference between a circle and a circular region. A circular region is union of circle and its interior.

DIAGRAM:

Question 3: A circle with centre A (marked inside). Two parallel horizontal chords PQ (top) and RS (bottom) are drawn inside the circle. P and Q are on the upper part, R and S on the lower part. A perpendicular from the centre connects both chords, and U is the point between them on this perpendicular line. PQ = 6 cm, RS = 8 cm, radius = 5 cm.

Question 4(i): A circle with centre O. Two chords are drawn inside the circle. The top chord has measurements: 15 on the left side from the chord endpoint to where the perpendicular from centre meets it, and 18 on the right segment. The bottom chord is labelled 24. The unknown variables y and a are marked on the figure. The perpendicular from the centre to the lower chord and the distances are shown.

Arc of a Circle (bottom of page): Two diagrams showing arcs. The left diagram shows a circle with centre P and two points B and A on the circle, with an arc drawn from B around to A (the minor arc). The right diagram shows a similar circle with centre P and points A on the right side, illustrating the concept of an arc as part of a circle.

=> angle AEC = 180 degrees - angle ABC = 180 degrees - 140 degrees = 40 degrees
=> angle AEB + angle BEC = 40 degrees     (angle sum postulate)

Key Fact:
If two arcs of a circle are unequal, then chord and angle corresponding to greater arc are greater.

=> 2 angle AEB = 40 degrees     (angle AEB = angle BEC)
=> angle AEB = 20 degrees

(b) As, AB = BC = CD     (given)
    angle AEB = angle BEC = angle CED = 20 degrees
    (Equal chords subtend equal angle at a point on the circumference.)
    Now, angle AED = angle AEB + angle BEC + angle CED = 20 degrees + 20 degrees + 20 degrees = 60 degrees

(c) angle BPD = 2 angle BED     (Angle at the centre is double the angle at a point on circumference.)
    = 2 x 40 degrees = 80 degrees

Example:
In the figure, chords EF || GH. Prove that:
EG (arc) = FH (arc)
Solution:
Draw EF and FG passing through centre of circle P.
angle EPG = 2 angle EFG     (Angle at the centre is double the angle at a point on the circumference.)
therefore angle EFG = (1/2) angle EPG     ... (i)

Similarly, angle FGH = (1/2) angle FPH     ... (ii)

But, angle EFG = angle FGH     (alternate angles)
therefore angle EPG = angle FPH     [from (i) and (ii)]

Hence, EG (arc) = FH (arc)     (Arcs subtending equal angles at the centre of circle are equal.)

Check Point:
Prove that non-parallel sides of a cyclic trapezium are equal.
