DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION:

The page is the front cover of the textbook. At the top, the text "Based on National Curriculum 2022-23" appears in bold. Below that, "Textbook of" is written in italic serif font, followed by the word "Mathematics" in very large, bold, dark serif lettering that dominates the center of the page. Below "Mathematics", the word "GRADE" appears in bold uppercase, and beneath it the number "10" is displayed in an extremely large, bold, dark grey/charcoal numeral.

In the lower-center portion of the page, there is a circular emblem/logo of the National Book Foundation, depicting an open book. Below the emblem, three lines of text read:
- "National Book Foundation" (bold)
- "Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training" (regular weight)
- "Government of Pakistan" (regular weight)

The overall design is clean and minimal, with a white/light grey background. A faint watermark reading "studyplusplus.com (study++)" is visible diagonally across the page.

DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION:

The page displays a "Table of Contents" heading at the top in a decorative banner with a dark background and ornamental flourishes. Below the heading is a neatly formatted table with three columns: "Sr. No." on the left, "Description" in the center (the widest column), and "P. No." on the right. The table has 13 rows, each with alternating light background shading. Each row has rounded-corner styling on the left and right edges. The serial numbers run from 1 to 13, listing the chapter titles and their starting page numbers. The layout is clean and uses a consistent font throughout.

**Complex Numbers**

When a and b are real numbers and b is allowed to be 0, the number a + bi is said to be complex.

A complex number is any number that can be written in the form of a + bi, where a and b are any real numbers and both a and b can be zero.

**Key Facts:**
- The numbers 2 + 5i, 7 - 11i, 18i are imaginary as b != 0 in these numbers. But they are also complex numbers.
- Complex number like 5i in which a = 0 and b != 0 are imaginary number with no real part. Such numbers are called pure imaginary numbers.
- As 6 can be written as: 6 + 0i. Therefore, every real number is a complex number with 0 as imaginary part.
- The set of complex numbers is denoted by C and R is a subset of C (R ⊆ C).

DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION:

The page contains a hierarchical classification chart (tree diagram) showing the relationship between different types of complex numbers. The chart flows from top to bottom:

**Top Level (Root Node):**
A rectangular box labeled "The complex number a + bi" with examples: 7, 2 + 7i, -11i.

**Second Level (Two Branches):**
The root node branches into two rectangular boxes connected by lines:

1. **Left branch** - "Imaginary number" box:
   - Definition: a + bi, b != 0
   - Examples: 7 + 3i, 2i, -(1/2)i

2. **Right branch** - "Complex numbers that are real numbers" box:
   - Definition: a + bi, b = 0
   - Examples: 4, sqrt(7), -11, 6

**Third Level:**
The left "Imaginary number" box branches further into two sub-boxes:

1. **Left sub-branch** - "Complex numbers" box:
   - Definition: a + bi, a != 0, b != 0
   - Examples: 2 + 3i, 5 - 7i

2. **Right sub-branch** - "Pure imaginary numbers" box:
   - Definition: a + bi, a = 0, b != 0
   - Examples: -7i, (1/3)i, 19i

The right "Complex numbers that are real numbers" box branches further into two sub-boxes:

1. **Left sub-branch** - "Irrational numbers" box:
   - Examples: sqrt(2), sqrt(7)

2. **Right sub-branch** - "Rational numbers" box:
   - Examples: (2/3), 7, -19, 2.5

All boxes are drawn with solid borders and connected by straight lines forming a tree structure. The chart is enclosed in a dashed rectangular border.

= (2825 + 5650J) / 2825 = 1 + 2J

The impedance will be 1 + 2J ohms.

**Example:** If z₁ = 5.5 + 5i, z₂ = 7.7 + 7i, then calculate:
a. z₁ + z₂                b. z₁z₂                c. z₁/z₂

**Solution:**

a. z₁ + z₂ = 5.5 + 5i + 7.7 + 7i = 13.2 + 12i

b. z₁z₂ = (5.5 + 5i)(7.7 + 7i) = 42.35 + 38.5i + 38.5i + 35i²
   = 7.35 + 77i

c. z₁/z₂ = (5.5 + 5i)/(7.7 + 7i) = (5.5 + 5i)/(7.7 + 7i) x (7.7 - 7i)/(7.7 - 7i) = (5.5 + 5i)(7.7 - 7i)/((7.7)² - (7i)²)

   = (42.35 - 38.5i + 38.5i - 35i²)/(53.9 - 49i²) = 77.35/102.9

**Solution of System of Equations with Complex Coefficients**

In this section, we shall find solution of different equations in complex variables either with real or complex coefficients. Consider the following equation:

pz + qw = r ......(i)

Where p, q and r are complex numbers (every real number is a complex number). The equation (i) is called a linear equation in two complex variables z and w.

p₁z + q₁w = r₁
p₂z + q₂w = r₂

These two equations together form a system of linear equations in two variables z and w. The linear equations in two variables are also called simultaneous linear equations.

**Example:** Solve:
z + w = 3i
2z + 3w = 2

**Solution:** Given equations are:

z + w = 3i ..........(i)
2z + 3w = 2 .......(ii)

**Quadratic Equations**

**After studying this unit students will be able to:**

- Define quadratic equations.
- Solve quadratic equations by graphical method, factorization and completing squares.
- Derive quadratic formula and use it to solve quadratic equations.
- Solve different types of equations which are reducible to quadratic form.
- Solve simultaneous equations. When one is homogenous and one is linear.
- Know nature of roots of a quadratic equation.
- Find relation between roots and coefficients of a quadratic equation.
- Define and evaluate symmetric functions of roots of a quadratic equation.
- Form a quadratic equation when its roots are given.

Algebra is your trusted tool that helps you carry out of various activities of daily importance. There is hardly any line of work that does not employ the concept of algebra. We will look at the variables and equation, you surely will not be wondered about why you need to leave there in a nutshell. Algebra and equations prepare you for hardly all aspects of life and stays with you right from your infanthood to your adulthood.

DIAGRAM DESCRIPTION:

The page is the opening page of Chapter 02 (Quadratic Equations). At the very top, there is a decorative header with a dark flowing wave/ribbon design in black and grey tones. Centered within the upper portion of this wave design is a white circle containing the chapter number "02" in bold text.

Below the wave design, the chapter title "Quadratic Equations" is displayed prominently in large, bold, dark serif font.

Beneath the title is a grey shaded box containing the learning objectives, introduced with the bold text "After studying this unit students will be able to:" followed by a bulleted list of nine objectives.

In the lower half of the page, there is a word cloud illustration related to "Algebra." The word "Algebra" appears as the largest, most prominent word in the center of the cloud, rendered in large dark decorative serif lettering. Surrounding it are various related mathematical terms in different sizes and orientations, including: "standard," "exponential," "rationals," "expression," "y-intercept," "inequality," "operations," "quadratic," "formula," "binomial," "linear," "slope," and "trinomial." The word cloud has a stylized artistic appearance meant to visually represent the breadth of algebraic concepts.

Below the word cloud, there is an introductory paragraph about algebra in regular text.
