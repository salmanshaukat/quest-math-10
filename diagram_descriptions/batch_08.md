The points are arranged roughly as: A at bottom-left, B at top-left, C at top, D at top-right, and E at bottom-right. Chords connecting consecutive vertices form the pentagon. Diagonals are also drawn inside the pentagon, creating internal line segments from each vertex to non-adjacent vertices.

Points are labelled: D at top, B at right, A at bottom (or left area), C at left (or bottom area). Line segments connect adjacent endpoints of the diameters (i.e., D to B, B to A, A to C, C to D), forming a square inscribed in the circle.

3. Question 13 diagram: A circle with centre O. Two chords AB and CD are drawn. Point A is at the upper-left, B is at the upper-right, and chord AB spans the upper part of the circle. Points C and D are at the right side of the circle. O is the centre. Lines are drawn from O to the chord endpoints. The angle ∠OAB = 40° is indicated.

**Example:**
A circular decoration piece consists of two equal parts as
shown in the figure. Find the length of one part of the piece.
What is the cost of decoration piece @ Rs.8 per centimetre?
**Solution:**
Given that r = 56 cm, θ = 90°, then:
l = (θ/360°) × 2πr = (90°/360°) × 2 × (22/7) × 56
l = 88 cm
Length of one part of the decoration piece is = 2 × 88 = 176 cm
Cost of decoration piece @ Rs.8 per cm = Rs. 2 × 176 × 8 = Rs. 2,816

   (i)  ∠PSQ    (ii) ∠SPQ    (iii) ∠OPQ
**Solution:**
(i) Join O and S.
    As OPS is right angled triangle, therefore:
    ∠OPS = 90°
    Also ∠POS = 20°  (Half of 40°. OS is angle bisector of ∠POQ.)
    ∴ ∠PSO = 90° − 20° = 70°
    Hence, ∠PSQ = ∠PSO + ∠QSO = 70° + 70° = 140°   (∠PSO = ∠QSO)

(ii) In △PQS, PS = QS    (Radii of same circle)
     ∴ ∠SPQ = ∠SQP   (Opposite angles of congruent sides of triangle)
     Let ∠SPQ = ∠SQP = x
     Then, x + x + ∠PSQ = 180°    ⇒  2x + 140° = 180°
     ⇒ 2x = 180° − 140° = 40°    ⇒  x = 20°
     Hence, ∠SPQ = ∠SQP = 20°

(iii) ∠OPQ = ∠SPO − ∠SPQ = 90° − 20° = 70°

**Example:** Find the measures of angles a and b in
the adjoining figure.
**Solution:**
As OQ and OR are tangents, therefore:
∠ORP = ∠OQP = 90°
Now OQPR is a kite.
∴  45° + 90° + a + 90° = 360°
⇒  a = 360° − 90° − 90° − 45° = 135°

As RS is a straight line and P lies on it.
∴  a + ∠QPS = 180°  ⇒  135° + ∠QPS = 180°
⇒  ∠QPS = 180° − 135° = 45°

In △PQS, PQ = PS    (Radii of same circle)
∴  ∠PQS = ∠PSQ   (Opposite angles of congruent sides of triangle)
Then, b + b + 45° = 180°    ⇒  2b + 45° = 180°
⇒  2b = 135°    ⇒  b = 67.5°

**Check Point:**
The distance of a point P from the
centre O of a circle of radius 6 cm, is
10 cm. Find the length of tangents to
the circle from P.

**Example:** Find the measures of angles x, y and z in
the adjoining figure.
**Solution:**
We know that:
∠BDC = ∠BCA   (Theorem 10.6)
y = 60°
In triangle BCD:
56° + y + z = 180°
