**I have Learnt**

* If a line is drawn perpendicular to a radial segment of a circle at its outer end point, it is tangent to the circle.
* The tangent to a circle and the radial segment joining the point of contact and the centre are perpendicular to each other.
* The two tangents drawn to a circle from a point outside the circle are equal in length.
* If two circles touch externally (internally), the distance between their centres is equal to the sum (difference) of their radii.
