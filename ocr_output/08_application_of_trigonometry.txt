Application of Trigonometry
After studying this unit students will be able to:
« Extend sine and cosine functions to angles between 90° and 180°.
| * Solve problems using laws of sines, cosines and the area formula for any triangle.
|» Solve simple trigonometric problems in three dimensions. |
| * Apply concepts of trigonometry to real life world problems such as video games, flight engineering, :
navigation and sound waves.
Burj Khalifa at Dubai is the tallest building in the world with tallest free-standing structure and
highest number of stories. It is 828 metres (2,716.5 feet) high and consists of more than 160
stories. How do scientists know its true height? A common way to measure the height involves
determining the angle of elevation, which is formed by the top of building and the ground at a
point some distance away from the base of the building. This method is much more practical
than climbing the building and dropping a very long tape measure or rope.

Trigonometric Ratios .
_ Quadrantal Angles
In a coordinate plane the two axes divide the plane in four equivalent parts called quadrants.
If terminal ray of an angle in standard position coincides with any axis, then it is called
quadrantal angle. The measure of a quadrantal angle is multiple of 90°.
For example; 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°, 360°, 450°, ... are quadrantal angles.
In radian measure quadrantal angle is a multiple of =. PWG kes ract: |

grade. We know that any triangle (in particular a right triangle) has K
six quantities, three sides and three angles. In the adjoining figure, a aN .

Let’s solve some examples to discuss the two cases.
Case 1: When Measures of two Sides are Given
Example: Solve the right triangle ABC in which y =90°,a=S5cem,c= 13cm.

Case 2: When Measures of one Side and one Angle are Given
Example: Solve the right triangle ABC in which y=90°, # = 45°, a=10cm.
Solution: Given: A right triangle ABC in which y=90°, 8 = 45°, a=10cm.
To Find: b,canda@.

Oblique Triangles
An oblique triangle is any triangle that is not a right triangle. It could be an acute triangle or it
could be an obtuse triangle. ,
) Acute Triangle Obtuse Triangle

The Pythagoras Theorem along with trigonometric ratios allow us to easily handle any given
right triangle problem, but what if the triangle is not a right triangle i.e. the triangle is
oblique?
To solve oblique triangles, we use certain laws known as “law of cosines”, “law of sines” and
“Tawnof tangents’ Law of Cesines
When we know the measures of two sides and the included angle of a triangle (SAS), the size
and shape of the triangle are determined. Therefore, we should be able to find the measure of
the third side of the triangle. Sometimes three sides of oblique triangles are given (SSS) and
we have to find the three angles of triangle. Such cases are easily handled by using law of
cosines.
Statement: .
If a, b, c are three sides and a, 8, are three angles of an oblique triangle with usual notation,
then law of cosines is stated as follows:

a’ =b’ +c? —2becosa ....... (1)

b? =a’ +c? —2accosf ........(2)

c* =a’ +b? —2abcosy..........(3)

Law of Sines
Law of cosines is not applicable when two angles and one side (AAS or ASA) or one angle
and two sides (angle not included (SSA)) of an oblique triangle are given. In order to handle
such situation, we use another law known as “law of sines”.
Statement:
If a, 6, c are three sides and a, 8, y are three angles of an oblique triangle with usual notation,
then law of sines is stated as follows:

(ii) | When sin # =1,there is one right triangle (one solution) if @ is acute and no

When q is obtuse and sin 8 <1, then # must be acute.
(i) If a+ <180°, there is only one AABC.
(ii) If a+" 2180", there is no triangle, so no solution.
Alternatively, if we let # = bsin a, the height of triangle, we can summarize the number of

Half Angle Formulae
Sometimes it is convenient to use half angle formulae for the solution of oblique triangles
when measures of three sides of a triangle are given. In this section, we will study half angles

Circles Connected with Triangles
(a) Circumcircle
A circle passing through the vertices of any triangle (polygon) iscalled circumcircle.
The centre of this circle is called the circumcentre and its radius is called the circumradius.
The radius of circumcircle is denoted by R.
A circle drawn inside and touching the sides of a triangle (polygon) is called incircle or
inscribed circle. It is the largest circle contained in the triangle. The centre of this circle is
called the incentre usually denoted by I and its radius is called the inradius denoted by r.
(c) Escribed Circle
A circle touching one of the sides of a triangle externally and the extensions of its two other
sides internally, is called an escribed circle (e-circle or ex-circle). The centre of this circle is
called the e-centre and its radius is called the e-radius.
If a circle touches extended arms of angle A (circle is drawn opposite to vertex A) of a
triangle ABC, then its centre and radius are respectively denoted by I; and r1. Similarly,

In this topic, we will learn about 3-D trigonometry. We will use combined knowledge of
Pythagoras’ theorem, trigonometric ratios, the law of sines (sine rule) and the law of cosines
(cosine rule) to find missing angles and sides of triangles in 3-dimensional shapes.

Step 2: Sketch and label the second triangle using information from Step 1,

AsP is a midpoint of DC, therefore APEF is amisosceles triangle.
Therefore, using law of cosines, we have:
