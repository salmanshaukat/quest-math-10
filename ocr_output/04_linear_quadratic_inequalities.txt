You are checking a bag at an airport. Bags can weigh no more than 60 pounds.
"Your bag weighs 26.5 pounds. Find the possible weights “Ww (in pounds) that you
can add to the bag.
Write a model:
Weight of bag + Weight you can add = Weight limit
265 +w = 60 (writing inequalities)
. 26.5 + w — 26.5. < 60 — 26.5 (subtracting 26.5 from both sides)
w<=33.5 (simplifying)

Graph of Inequality
On a number line, the graph of an inequality in one variable is the set of points that represents
all solutions of the inequality. To graph an inequality in one variable, we use open circle for the
symbols ‘<’ or ‘>’ and a closed circle for the symbols ‘<’ or ‘>’. .

Solving Quadratic Inequalities ;
We will discuss the solution of quadratic inequalities in one variable. Quadratic inequalities can
be derived from quadratic equations. The word ‘Quadratic’ comes from the word ‘Quadratum’
' which means square in Latin. From this, we can define quadratic inequalities on second degree
equation. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax” +bx+c =0. Further if the quadratic
polynomial ax’?+bx+c is not equal to zero, then they are either ax’+hx+c>0 or
. ax’ +bx+c<0 and are called quadratic inequalities. We explain quadratic inequalities with
daily life example. .
Consider a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second.
The function h(t) = 64 t — 16 t? gives the height of the ball after ) rts
t seconds. During what time span is the ball in flight? We can find ' *; ,
the times that the ball is in flight by solving the inequality ; :
64t—16t?>0. |» ¢ ‘|
64t — 16t? > 0 P | : i
—16t* + 64t > 0 |
—16t(t-—4) >0 VA Z |
This inequality shows that the product of two numbers is positive Rte
if both of the numbers (-16r, t—4) are positive or both are negative.
Case I: Case II: |
When both numbers are positive | When both numbers are negative
-l6t>0 and r-4>0 —l6t<0 and ¢-4<0
_t<0 and t>4 t>0 and t<4
Here, t< 0 and at the same time t > 4 Means: 0<f and 1<4
is never true. 2 eae: O<tr<4
The solution set is {0 < t < 4}. So, the ball is in flight between 0 and 4 seconds after it is thrown.
Example; Solve x’-4x-12>0 ° | .
Solution: x? —4x—-12>0
/ x*—6x+2x-12>0 => x(x-6)+2(x-6)>0 :
=> § (x-6)(x+2)50 |
Another way that you can solve quadratic inequalities is by using three test points. }
First solve the equation (x—6)(x+2)=0 - ‘
x-6=0o0rx+2=0.
=> x=6,x=-2
These solutions are called critical points. The points —2 and 6 separate the x-axis into three
regions:-x<-—2, -2<x<6, x>6.

Solving System of Linear Inequalities .
Mr. Waleed wants to rent a car for a business trip. A car rental company advertises that their
rental rate is Rs.9000 plus Rs.60 per km. Mr. Waleed would like to compare this rate with the

rates offered by other car rental agencies. First, he determines the equation containing the points

that represent the relationship between the numbers

of km (x) and the total cost of the rental (y). The | /

initial cost of the car is Rs. 9000. Since this is the 15000 -- -

point where zero km are driven, it would be the | y,

Suppose you and your friend, each live in the same street as your school, but on opposite sides
of the school. You each live 6 km from the school. What can you say about your trips to school
each day? Do you each travel the same distance?
Consider placing both houses and the school on a number line with the school at the origin. .
Your home is located at 6, and your friend is located at —6. ‘
Certainly, —6. and 6 are quite different but they do have something in common. They have the
same distance from 0 on the number line. This means that you and your friend travel the same
distance, but in different direction, when you go to school.
: 6 units _ 6 units
We say that —6 and 6 have the same absolute value. The absolute value of a number is the
number of units it is from 0 in the number line. |
We use the symbol |x| to represent the absolute value of a number x.
The absolute value of 6 is |6|=6, and absolute value of —6. is |-6|=6. |

In words: The definition states that the absolute value of a non-negative is the number itself and
the absolute value of a negative number is the opposite of the number.
Since distance is always non-negative, we can think of a number’s absolute value as its distance
from zero on number line.

Inequalities With Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. We can use this idea
to solve inequalities involving absolute value.
Example: Solve |x| < 5. .
Solution: |x|<5S means that the distance between x and 0 is less than five units. To make jx]<5
true, we must substitute the values of x that are less than five units from 0.
6 4932 4 1 2 4 5 6
All the number between — 5 and 5 are less than 5 units from zero.
The absolute solution set = {|x|:—5 < x < 5}.
_ Example: Solve|x| 23... Graph the solution. .
Solution: The solution of |x| 23. are those numbers whose distance from 0 is greater than or
equal to 3. In other words, those numbers x such that x<—3 or x23. The solution set is

- Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities |
A system of linear inequalities in two variables or simply a system of inequalities consists of
two or more linear inequalities in the same variable. As:
x-y>9 Inequality I } kk .
2x+y<9 Inequality I
A solution of a system of linear inequalities is an ordered pair that is a solution of each
inequality in the system. For example, (7, — 6) is a solution of the system A. .
The graph of a system of linear inequalities is the graph of all solutions of the system.
Example: Graph the system of inequalities: [ = es |

e Ona number line, the graph of an inequality in one variable is the set of points that
represent all solutions of the inequality. .
© To graph an inequality in one variable are an open circle for < or > and a closed
circle for = or =.
* Dividing / multiplying each side of an inequality by a positive number produces an
equivalent inequality.
_ © Dividing / multiplying each side of an inequality by anegative number and
reversing the direction of the inequality symbol produces an equivalent inequality.
© A linear inequality in two variables, such as ax +by <c is the result of replacing
the “=” sign in a linear equation with <, <, > or >. -
* A solution of an inequality in two variables x and y is an ordered pair (x, y) that
_ produces a true statement when the values of x and y are substituted.into the
inequality. ;
. © The boundary line for an inequality in one variable is either vertical or horizontal.
* Ifan inequality has only the variable x, substitute the x-coordinate of the test point
*. into the inequality.
¢ Ifan inequality has only the variable y, substitute the y-coordinate of the test point
into the inequality.
* A solution ofa system of linear inequalities is an ordered pair that is a solution of
_ €ach inequality inthe system. _
, * The graph of a system of linear inequalities is the graph of all solutions of the system.
