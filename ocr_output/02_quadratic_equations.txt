. Quadratic Equations
Saleem wants to build a swimming pool surrounded by a sidewalk of uniform width. He wants
the dimensions of the pool and sidewalk to be 16 meters by 20 meters. The pool has an area of
192 square meters. How wide should the sidewalk be?
Let x meters be the width of the sidewalk. _ 20m —_
The length of a pool is 20 — 2x meters. ef ||
The width of the pool is 16 — 2x meters. x | x |
The area of the pool can be expressed as the -
product of the length and width. ‘om |
Area = Length x Width |
= 4x? —72x +320
The area of the pool can be expressed as 4x” -72x+320 square meters. Since the area of the
pool is 192 square meters, replacing area with 192 results in the equation192 = 4x” —72x +320.
Saleem would probably never use a quadratic equation like 192 = 4x” —72x+320 to express
area of a pool. However, in this unit we will study many other formulas in science and business
that involve this type of equations.
Quadratic Equation
It is an equation that can be written in the form of ax’? +bx+c=0, where a#0. We say that
equations like this have a degree of 2. Since the greatest exponent of the variable is 2. We
observe that this quadratic equation only has one variable and all the exponents are positive.
Standard Quadratic Equation
ax? +bx+c=0 is a standard form of the quadratic equation in one variable x. The equation
. x? 4+6x+5=O0is in standard form. _ )
(e419? =4 and x? +3x=18 are examples of quadratic equation in one variable x but they are
not in standard form.
Example: Write the following quadratic equations in standard form,

Solution of Quadratic Equations
The values of variables for which an equation becomes a true sentence are called solutions or
roots of the equation. i.e. if P(a) = c, then x = a is root of the equation P(x) = c. The set of roots
of an equation is called the solution set. A quadratic equation in one variable has two roots.
These roots of the quadratic equation can be found in many ways. In this section we will study
four methods. ie ae ee "p a nes Soar. |

IV. Using Quadratic Formula eg, ae Vo «
One way to determine the roots of a quadratic equation is to graph the related quadratic
function. Write the equation in general form like:
192 = 4x" —72x +320 , a 1
0=4x* —72x+128 subtract 192 from each side. 2o|

Notice that the function crosses the x-axis twice and the function has adegree of 2. These
intercepts points are called the zero of a function. The x values, 2 and 16 are the roots of the
equation x —18x+32=0 | —} >

—3 and 5, where the curve intersects the x-axis.
Another way of solving a quadratic equation is by factoring. The factoring method depends on the
zero-product property.
Zero Product Property:
For any real number a and b, ifab=0, then eithera=QOorb=0. - 7
i. To solve the quadratic equation by factorization first write it in standard form, then
factorize the polynomial on the left-hand side of the equation.
ii. | Use zero product property.
iii. | Now solve linear equations and write solution set.
Fr example, to solve x* = 4 by factorization we do the following steps:
x= 4
x-4=0 (standard form)
(x— 2)(x+ 2) =0 (factorization)
x- 2 =0o0rx+2=0 (linear equations )
x= 2orx= -—2 (roots)
SS. = {-2, 2} ( solutionset) |
Example: Factorize to solve the equations.
i x? -18x+32=0 ii, x ~2x-15=0.
Solution:
i. x?—18x+32=0 ii, x? -—2x-15=0
x? —16x —2x+32=0 — x? —Sx+3x—-15=0
(x — 2)(x — 16) =0 (x —5)(x +3) =0
x—-2=0 or x-—16=0 x-5=O0orx*x+3=0

In a city, a square field has been maintained for playing. Each side of sea fen = on song
The management has decided to equally expand two of the sides of the field or par me ! 4 . °
so that the entire region has an area of 14000 m2, What is the width of the parking strip being
added? .


--- Page 31 ---

Let x represents the width of each parking strip.
After expanding each side of the field would be .
110+x meters long.
The equation expresses the area of the new field, - 110m x(m)
which is still square. —— } -
(x + 110)* = 14000 }
V(x + 110)? = ¥14000 Sitar
x +110 = +V14000 |
x = —110 + ¥14000 _
x , x(m)| |
Where the negative value is neglected. -
Quadratic equations can be solved in the same way.as long as one side of the equation containsa ~
perfect square. When the equation does not contain a perfect square, we can use process called
completing the square to create a perfect square. :
For an expression of the form x? + bx, we can add a constant c in the expression so that the
expression x? + bx + c is a perfect square trinomial. This process is called completing square.
Procedure
Step I: Write the equation in standard form, ‘
Step II: Shift constant term to the right hand side of the equation.
Step III: To make the left hand side a complete square; add a suitable term to both sides of
the equation. If the coefficient of x’ is 1, then it is easy to complete the square.
Just add the square of half the coefficient ofxand get acomplete square.
Step IV: Take the square root on both sides and form two linear equations.
Step V: Solve the linear equations and find roots. 3
Example: . a - Describe the error.

iv. Quadratic Formula
We have learnt several ways to solve quadratic equations. Each has its limitations. The question
we think is that is there any formula that will work for any quadratic equation? The answer is
‘yes’ and the formula is called the quadratic formula. The formula is derived from solving the
general form of a quadratic equation for x.

Equation Reducible to Quadratic Form
Some equations are not quadratic, but to solve them we can reduce them to quadratic form.
The example below illustrates solving an equation that is not a quadratic equation itself, but contains
a factor that is. a quadratic. The method we use to solve the quadratic part of that equation.
Example: A cuboid box has a base that is x cm long. The width of the base is 2 cm less than its
length. The height is 3 cm greater than the length of the base. The measure of the volume is 6 times
the measure of the length of the base. Find the dimensions of the box.
Solution:
The volume of the rectangular box is the product of
the length, width and height of box.

As, V = x(x — 2)(x + 3) soveeee (ii) | F
“ 6x = x(x —2)(x +3) (from (i) and (ii)) ne,
6x = x3 +x? — 6x => x3 +x?-—12x=0 : |
x(x? +x—12)=0 => x(x —3)(x+4) =0
We use the zero-product property
x=0, x+4=0, x-3=0
x=0,x=-4,x=3
Since we are dealing with the dimensions of a box, |
we ignore 0 and —4, the solution is:
length x =3
width =x-2=3-2=|]
height = x+3=3+3=6
Hence, the dimensions of the box are 3cm* Icmx 6cm.
We have many types of equations that are not quadratic, but we can write in a form that
resembles a quadratic equation. For example, the equation 9x* —8x*-1=Ocan be written as:
9(x°)’ -8x2-1=0. Equations that can be writtemin this way are said to be equations reducible
to quadratic form.
Some of equations that can be reduced to quadratic equations, are given below,
Equations of the Form ax‘ + bx* +c = 0
It is an equation of degree 4. It can be reduced to quadratic form by using the substitution .
r= y.In this way the above equation becomes ay" +by +c = 0. Solve it by any of the three
methods discussed earlier. Replace y with its substitute x2. Find valucs of x by taking the square

Equations of the Form aP(x) + a =c
To solve this type of equation, use a substitution P(x) = y. Multiply the equation by y and form
a quadratic equation involving the variable y. Solve the new equation for y and replace y by
P(x). In this way, you will get two simple equations involving variable x. Solve these equations
and write the solution set.

Reciprocal Equations
If an equation is not affected by the replacement of a variable by its reciprocal, then it is
called a reciprocal equation. The reciprocal of a root of such an equation is also its root.

Equations (i) and (ii) are same.
To solve the reciprocal equation (i), arrange it in the form
a( x +}+0(x+4} emo :

Puty = x+ - and find the value of x? + + = y? -2.
In this way equation (i) is reduced to quadratic form. Solve this equation for y and then replace
y with its substitute x + =. Finally find values of x and write solution set.

Exponential Equations
An equation involving expressions of the form 4” is called an exponential equation where k is
a constant. In exponential equations the exponents are variables. We will discuss only those
exponential equations which can be reduced to quadratic form. : ;
Exponential equations reducible to quadratic form are of the type:
ak? +bk* +c =0,a #0.
We use the substitution k* = y to reduce the above equation to quadratic form. Then we find
y and replace it with &*. In this way, roots of the exponential equations are found,
Example: Solve the following exponential equations

Equations of the Form @& + a)(x + b)(Qx+c)\xt+d=k; at+b=ct+d
In this type, we multiply the pairs of factors after rearranging them in such a way that the
variable terms of both products are the same or one of them is multiple of the other. Choose a
substitute for the common terms and form a quadratic equation. Solve the new equation and
then replace the substitute. Find the values of original variable involved in the given equation
and write the solution set.

These four examples demonstrate a pattern that is useful in determining the nature of the roots
of a quadratic equation. In the quadratic formula, the expression under the sign ‘b?- 4ac’, is
called the discriminant. The discriminant tells the nature of roots of a quadratic equation.

The above chart shows that if the value of the discriminant is a perfect.square or 0, the roots are
real and rational. Other positive discriminant will yield irrational roots. A negative discriminant
means roots will be imaginary/complex.

quadratic equation but we do not know the equation itself. Consider the roots ofa quadratic

Simultaneous Equations
A system of equations having a common solution is called a system of simultaneous equations.
The set of all the ordered pairs (x, y) which satisfies the system of equations is called the solution
of the system. System of two equation involving two variables.
System of two Equations Involving two Variables
Case I: When one Equation is Linear and One Quadratic


--- Page 49 ---

If one of the equations is linear, we can find the value of one variable in terms of the other
variable from linear equation. Substituting this value-of one variable in the quadratic equation,
we can solve it. The procedure is illustrated through the following example.
Example: Solve the system of equations x+ y=7 and x’ —xyyt+y’ =13
Solution: Given Equations are re ;

From equation (i)
x=7-y , ,
Substituting in equation (ii)
(7-y)'-(7-y)y+-y? =13 | |
49-l4y+y?-Ty+y?+y’? =13 ,
3y’ -21y+36=0 |
| yp =-7Ty+12=0 os
y’ —4y-3y+12=0
Wy —-4)-3(y - 4) =0 .
(y-4)(y-3) =0 SO
y-4=0 or y-3=0 .
Putting y=3,in (i), we get x=7-3=4
Putting y = 4, in (i), we get x=7-4=3
Hence solutionsetis {(4, 3), (3, 4)} . :
Case II: When both of the Equations are Quadratic .
The equations in this case are classified as:
(i) Both the equations contain only x2 and y’ terms. _
(ii) One of the equations, is homogeneous in x and y, |
(iii) Both the equations are non-homogeneous.
The methods of solving these types of equations are explained through the following examples.
Example: Solve the system of equations x? + y’=25 and 2x?+3y? =66
Solution: Given equations are |
x +y=25 (i) 2x7 43y? =66 (ii)
Multiplying equation (i) by 2 and subtracting from equation (ii). : .
2x" +3y? = 66
+2x?+2y? =50 |
Putting y’=16 in equation (i) . ’

x =9
Now from x’? =9, we have x=+3
and from y =16, we have y=+4
Hence, solutionsetis {(+3, +4)}
Example:
Solve the system of equations x’ + y? =20 and 6x’ +xy—y" =0
Solution:
Given equations are
x+y? = 20 (i)
6x° +xy—y’ =0 (ii)

. y -—xy- 6x" -=0
y? —3xy + 2x 6x? =0
yy — 3x) +2x(y —32x) = 0
(y—3x)(y+2x)=0
y-3x=0 or y+2x=0
y =3x..2.(iii) y= —2x.....fi¥)
Putting y =3x in (i) ) Putting = —2x in (i)
x? +(3x)y° = 20 x? +(-2x)? =20
x° +9x" =20 x? +4x? =20
. 10x* = 20 5x* =20.
x’ =2 x=4
x=tV2 , ro42
When x=2 When x=2
From (iii) ” y=3V2 From (iv) ~ xe’
When x=—V2, When x=-2
From (iii) y= 3/2 From (iv) y=4
Hence, solution set is {(2, 3/2), (V2, —3V2), (2, -4), (-2, 4)}
