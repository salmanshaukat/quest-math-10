scored 97 points, Class 9 (girls) scored 93 points, class 9 (boys) scored 90 points, class 10 (girls)
scored 96 points and class 10 (boys) scored 94 points. This information can be displayed as under:

This method is no doubt easy to write and manipulate. In 1850, Sylvester introduced such
rectangular arrangement and he named it ‘Matrix’. Later Hamilton and Cayley made further
significant contributions to the Matrix Algebra, Today matrices are being used in almost every
academic discipline in building models, organizing data and solving real world problems.

e Elements ofa matrix are written within the square brackets in'a definite order, in rows and
e Capital alphabets are used to name a matrix while elements of a matrix are usually
represented by small alphabets and numbers.
Row: Horizontal arrangement of elements in a matrix is called a row.
First row and second row of a matrix are represented by Ri and R2 respectively.
Column: . Vertical arrangement of elements is in a matrix called a column.

The number of rows and columns may be equal or unequal in any matrix, however the number of
elements in different rows and in different columns remains the same. In ; ; 9) there are 2
rows and 3 columns. There are 3 elements in each row and 2 elements ineach column.
Order of Matrix
If ‘A’ is a matrix with ‘m’ number of rows and ‘n’ number
of —_ then order of the matrix is m-by-n. Tue taaitices aks eqiiivalent

Equal Matrices
Two matrices are said to be equal if and only if their: *

Example: .
Check whether the following pairs of matrices are equal or not. Mention the reason in each case.

. ® Matrices on both sides of equality are of order 2-by-1
° Corresponding elements of the matrices on both sides of equality are also equal. |
Hence both matrices are equal.

Order of matrix A is 2-by-1. Order of matrix B is 1-by-2. Order is different, we can say A + B.

Addition, Subtraction and Scalar Multiplication of Matrices
Addition and Subtraction of Matrices
Two matrices can be added or subtracted only if their order is same.
Consider A = A ,B=[5 3],C= [I Here addition and subtraction of A and B is impossible
because their order is not same.
However, addition and subtraction of A and C is possible as their order is same.


--- Page 61 ---

e Inthe process of addition or subtraction of matrices, only corresponding elements are
added or subtracted. |
¢ Matrices of same order are conformable for addition and subtraction.
Example: If 4 = [7.9] and B= [7] then find A+B, A—B, B+A, B—A.

of matrix addition. .

Additive Identity in Matrices

‘subtracting from’ it. Any matrix and its additive identity matrix have the same order.

A)
* In multiplication, the first matrix contributes its number of rows and the second matrix
contributes its number of columns, in the resultant matrix. i.e. If order of matrix A is m-by-n
and order of matrix B is n-by-p, then order of AB is m-by-p.
¢ If A and B are two matrices which are conformable for product AB then B and A are not
necessarily confirmable for product BA.

Example:

Mention order of product if possible.

Multiplicative Inverse of a Matrix :
Before we discuss inverse of a matrix, we need to examine the determinant of a matrix.
Determinant ofa Matrix = . |
When a matrix has m rows and n columns, it is called an “‘ m-by-n” matrix and is also called
dimensions of a matrix. If a matrix has the same number of rows and columns, it is called a square
matrix. With every square matrix is associated a number called its determinant, defined as follows °

Solution of Simultaneous Linear Equations
A large-scale use of matrices in almost every field is in the form of solution of simultaneous linear
equations, While studying Economics, Statistics, Medical Sciences, Engineering etc, one has to
find the solution of linear equations in two or more variables. However, our study at this level is
confined to the solution of simultaneous linear equations only in two variables.

We discuss here two methods for finding solution of liner equations in two variables.
(a) Matrix inversion method (b) Cramer’s rule

(a) Matrix Inversion Method
Let us find the solution of:
Sxt4y=14 ; 3x+Ty=13 ” ,
This system of equations can'be rewritten in matrix equation as follows: .

Where A = P ,] is a matrix of coefficients, X = | is a matrix of variables and
B= [3] is a matrix of constants, ,
Now equation (i) can also be written as: ;
AX=B , , :
ATAX=A™B — (Pre multiplying with A” if it exists.)
IX=A"B (A'A=1T ,
This equation indicates that the values of the variables in the matrix X are equal to the
_ _, Corresponding elements:in the matrix A™' B. To find A“! B, we need A”.
As, |A| =|? ‘| = 35 — 12 = 23 + 0, so inverse is possible,
Also, adjA=[3 —*| .
Now, A“ = lal adj A = 23 * 3 5 | .
Substituting the values in equation (ii), we get:

Comparing the elements of both matrices, we see that x = 2 and y= 1 solution set = {(2,1)}

As the matrix A is a singular, so its multiplicative inverse does not exist and solution of given
system of equation is not possible. .
(b) Cramer’s Rule
This method is named after Gabriel Cramer (1704 -1752). This rule uses determinants to find the
solution of system of linear equations.
Consider a system of linear equations as x + 2y=6, 4x-—2y = 4. |
Writing it in matrix equation, we get:

~ OO Applications of Matrices
The most difficult part of solving a problem in algebra is almost always translating the problem
situation to mathematical language. Once an equation is translated, the rest is usually
straightforward. In this section, we study systems of equations and how to solve them using
matrices. We can use matrices to help us solve problems that involve. systems of equations. Using
matrices often simplifies the process of solving these systems. . |
Example: .
Anas bought 3 cream puffs and 5 pringle packs paying Rs.650. Abid bought 4 cream puffs and 2
pringle packs paying Rs. 400. Find how much each item costs? (Hint: Either matrix inversion
method or Cramer’s rule can be used).
Solution: _
Let x be the cost of a cream puff and y be the cost of 4 pringle pack, then Anas’s shopping is
represented by 3x + 5y= 650 and Abid’s shopping is represented by equation 4x + 2y = 400
Writing in matrix equation
3 5) [x] .. 7650) | y=
hi 2 | “€ [tool or = AX=B Ry
Now by using Cramer’s rule
D=|Al=|{ 3|=6-20=~-14
D, = | 400 | = 1300 — 2000 = -700, Dy | 1 1001 1200 — 2600 = —1400
Now, x = = and y = “ -
x= 2 and y= => x=50° and y= 100 ,
So, each cream puff costs Rs, 50 and each pringle pack costs Rs. 100.
Example: &
Naveed is a chemist who is preparing an acid solution to be used as a cleaner for machine parts.
The machine shops need several batches of 200 ml of solution at a 48% concentration. He only
has 60% and 40% concentration solutions. The two solutions can be combined to make the 48%
solution. How much of each solution should Naveed use to make 200 ml of solution?
Solution: . )
Let x represent the amount of 60% solution and let y represent the amount of 40% solution.
x+y=200 The total of two amount must be 200 ml.
Now write an equation that represents the proportions of each solution needed.
(Mate — 60% + 40% =48% - : .
“60% (x) + 40% (v) = 48% (x+y) Each part contribute to the total
0.60 (x) +:0.40 (vy) = 0.48 (x+y) Multiply 100 to remove the decimals
"  12x-8y=0 ' _ Write the equation in standard form .
Step 1: Write a system of equations. Then write the system as a matrix equation.

We have x= 80 and y = 120. .
This means that 80:ml of the 60% solution is added to 120 ml of the 40% solution to make
200 ml of the 48% solution.
