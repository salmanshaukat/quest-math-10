‘Applications of Mathematics :
Complex Numbers: Complex numbers play a critical role in fields such as engineering,
electronics, and quantum physics. They are especially valuable for modeling oscillations in
alternating current (AC) circuits, which are foundational to modern electrical systems, and for
analyzing waveforms and resonances that occur naturally in many types of physical systems.
Quadratic Equations: Quadratic equations model a range of phenomena. In physics, they
describe projectile motion; in finance, they are used for profit and cost optimization; and in
architecture, they inform structural designs by calculating load distributions and parabolic
shapes for stability.
Matrices and Determinants; Matrices are essential in solving complex systems of equations and
executing transformations in areas like computer graphics and machine learning. Determinants,
closely related to matrix invertibility, provide insights into properties of shapes and can be used
to calculate area, volume, and to determine if linear systems have unique solutions.
Linear and Quadratic Inequalities: Linear and quadratic inequalities express ranges of values
that satisfy given conditions, such as acceptable income levels, speed limits, or temperature
thresholds. In real life, they are essential in budgeting, optimizing resources in industries,
setting safety regulations, and environmental monitoring, where certain parameters must stay
within safe or efficient boundaries.
Algebraic Fractions: Algebraic fractions simplify relationships found in finance (like calculating
compound interest), physics (such as wave motion and light refraction), and data science (for
probability ratios and odds in statistical models). They allow complex relationships to
expressed in simpler, comparable terms.
Functions and Graphs: Functions are mathematical tools that map inputs to outputs, visualized
through graphs to represent relationships between variables, such as speed over time, cost
versus quantity, or population growth over years. These graphical representations are
fundamental in economics, biology, and physics, where understanding variable relationships is
key to predicting and modeling real-world changes.
Vectors: Vectors combine magnitude and direction, making them indispensable in applications
like navigation, physics (force and velocity calculations), and engineering (stress analysis in
materials). In computer graphics, they help in rendering movements and 3D transformations,
contributing to realistic visualizations.
Trigonometry: Trigonometry is crucial for solving right and non-right triangles. Its applications
span navigation, construction, and astronomy, where precise distance and angle measurements
are essential, from mapping locations to constructing stable structures.
Chords and Arcs of a Circle: Understanding chords and arcs forms the basis of circular geometry,
used extensively in design, architecture, and mechanical engineering, where curves and circular
components (like gears or wheels) must be accurately measured and constructed.
Tangents and Its Construction: A tangent touches a circle at one point, forming a right angle
with the radius at that point. This principle has practical applications in road and race track
design gear construction, and analyzing rotational motion, where precision at points of contact
is crucial. Constructing tangents, arcs, and circular sections is fundamental in structural design,
architecture, bridge engineering, and urban planning.
Statistics: Statistics, through measures like mean, median, mode, range, and standard
deviation, help summarize and interpret data trends. Statistics play an essential role in business
forecasting, healthcare analytics, social sciences, and environmental studies, where decisions
must be made based on reliable data insights.

Until the sixteenth century, mathematicians were puzzled by square roots of a negative numbers.
For example, the solutions of.x? — 2 = 0 are ¥2, and — ¥2. But what are the solution of x? + 2 = 0?
To find the solution of this equation, imaginary numbers were defined.
A French mathematician René Descartes was the first to emphasize the imaginary nature of
numbers, positing that “one can imagine as many (numbers) as already mentioned in each
equation, but sometimes, there is no quantity that matches what we imagine.”
However, in 16th century an Italian mathematician Gerolamo Cardano, proved that having a
negative term inside a square root can lead to the solution of an equation. .
Later, in the 18th century, mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss consolidated Cardano’s
premises, in addition to developing a treatise on complex numbers in a plane and thereby
established the modern bases of the term. .

roots. This system is called the complex number system and it makes use of a number that is a
square root of —1. We call this new number i. ee,

Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers
The complex numbers obey the commutative, associative and distributive law. Thus, we can add anc
subtract them as we do binomials. Moreover, the sum and difference of two complex numbers is also :
complex number. Ifz, =a + bi and z,=c + di are two complex numbers then their sum and difference i:
defined as:
Sum: Add real part.in real part and imaginary part in imaginary part.
Z, + Z2= (a + bi) +(c + di)=(a +c) +(b+d)i ,
Difference: Subtract real part in real part and imaginary part in imaginary part.
“Z, —Z,=(a + bi) -(e + di) =(a—c)+ (b-ad)i
Example: Simplify:
a. (74+5i)+(44+3i) b. (5+6f)-(7-4i)
Solution: . | |
a, (7+5i)+(4+3i) p, (5+6i)-(7-4i)
=7+5i+44+3i =5+6i-74+4i
= 7+4+5i+3i (combine real and =5-—7+6i+4i (combining real and
ef =11+8 | imiginary parts) =—-2+10i imiginary parts)
Multiplication of Complex Numbers .
Ifa + bi and c + di are two complex numbers then their product can be found by using distributive
law.
(a + bi\(c + di) = ale + di) + bile + di) = ac + adi + bei + bd?*
=ac +adi+bci-bd =(ac—bd)+(ad+be)i .....(as2=-1) -
Therefore, the product of two complex numbers is also:a complex number. .
For complex numbers, the property VaVb =~J/ab does not hold in general, but it does when a -
is negative and b is a non-négative number, —
_ To express square root of negative numbers, we first express them in terms of i. For example:
‘ V-3x4/ —7 = -1V3 x J-1V7 = i3xiv7 = 7/21 =—V21: correct: :
But, f-2 xV-5 = J-Q)-5) = VI0 is wrong.
_ Example: Multiply and simplify:
a. V—2v-11 b. —2i.5i c. —3i(2 —Bi)
d. V—9 /—36 e. (3—2i)(1 + Si) ff. 6-09-30
Solution: , |
a, V—2V=11 = V=1V2 x V=IVl = iv2 x iVT1 = 2V2x11 = -V22 |
b. —2i.5i = —10(i?) = —10(—1) = 10 (as i? = —1)


--- Page 10 ---

c. —3i(2 —8i) = —6i + 24(i7) = -6i + 24(—1) = —6i — 24 = —24 - Gi

d. V—9¥—36 = V—-1x 9 v—1 x 36 = V—1V9 x V—1V36 = i3 x i6 = 1817 = -18

e. (3—2{)(1+5i) = 3+ 15i—2i — 10? = 3 + 13 — 10(—-1) = 13 + 13%

f (5—i)(9 —3i) = 45 — 15i — 91 + 3i* = 45 — 241 + 3(—-1) = 42 — 24
Powers of i .
We now want to simplify certain expressions involving higher powers of i. simplifying powers
of j can then be done by using the fact that i> =—1 and expressing the given power of / in terms
of i’. Consider: , .

4 (72)\2 = (-1)2 = 1

3 =i2.¢=(-1).i=-i piel ie (p=)
The powers of i cycle themselves through the values of i, -1, —i and |.

, Conjugates of Complex Numbers )

Conjugate of complex number is a complex number obtained by changing the sign of the
imaginary part. In simple words, conjugate of a complex number is a number that has the same
real part as the original complex number, and the imaginary part has the same magnitude but
opposite sign. “
The conjugate of a complex number a + ib is a — ib, .
For example, the conjugate of 5+ 6 is 5— 6 and that of 3—11i is 3+11i.
Commonly, the complex number is denoted by z and its conjugate by Z.
For example, if z=11+7/ then z= 11+ 7i = 11-—7i

Example: Find the conjugate: .
a. 5497 ~b. 13-Si c. —5—-Ti . d. Il
Solution: 7 |
a, 54+97 the conjugate is 5—9j b. 13—5y the conjugate is 13+5i
c. —5—7i the conjugate is —5+7/ d. 11i the conjugate is -11i
, Division of Complex Numbers
Dividing complex numbers is a little more complicated than addition, subtraction, and
multiplication of complex numbers because it is difficult to divide a number by an imaginary
number.
For dividing complex numbers, we need to find a term by which we can multiply the numerator and
the denominator that will eliminate the imaginary part of the denominator so that we end up with a
real number in the denominator.
Ifz,=x,+iy, andz,=x,+iy, are the two complex numbers, then division of z, by z, is written as:
a= 50%... (i) .
Zz X2+lyz
To eliminate the imaginary part in the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator
of (i) by the conjugate of x, + iy, i.e. by x, — iy,
oo Zz = xXgtivz x2-iy2 a .
After that, we simplify the expression (ii).
Steps for Dividing Complex Numbers .
To divide the two complex numbers, follow these steps: .
« First, calculate the conjugate of the complex number-that is at the denominator of the
’ fraction. oo
. ¢ Multiply the conjugate with the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction.
: ° Apply the algebraic identity (a + b) (a—b) =a?—&* in the denominator and substitute
« Apply the distributive property in the numerator and simplify.
* Separate the real part and the imaginary part of the resultant complex number.

Additive Inverse of Complex Numbers .
If z= a+ biis a complex number then its additive inverse is -z = —a — bi.
In the same way, additive inverse of —z = —a — bi is z = a + Di.
Sum of a complex number and its additive inverse is zero.
z+(—z) = (a+ bi) + (-a— bi) =a+bi-—a—bi=0=0+01
Example: -
Find the additive inverse of 3—2i. vs 7 |
Solution: . Equality of Complex Numbers
Let.a+bi be the additive inverse of 3—2/. ee complex numbers sie:
wii 6 tats ee and c + di are equal then:
Then by additive inverse rule: - -
(3 — 2i) + (a + bi) = 0 + 01 earEatend
(3 +a) +(-2i+ bd) =0+0i
(3 +a) + (—2+b)i=0+0i |
Comparing real and imaginary parts of both sides, we get:
3+a=0;-24+b=0 = a=-3;b=2
Thus, additive inverse of 3 = 2i is 3 + 2i.
- Direct Method: )
We can apply the rule that additive inverse is the opposite sign of 3-2 that is —3+2i,
Similarly the additive inverse of —7+11f is 7—1 li.

Geometrical Representation of Algebraic Operations

The graphical representation of algebraic operations in the complex number system
makes it easier to understand the concepts.
(i) Geometrical Representation of Addition QZ) RZ +25)
Geometrically, addition of two complex numbers z, and z, —a .
can be visualized as addition of the vectors by using the ij
parallelogram law. The vector sum Z, + 2, is represented [A PZ)
by the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by the two “~~ Ol Real axix
original vectors. | a
If two points P and Q represent complex numbers z, and z,
respectively in the Argand Plane, then the sum z, + Z, is
represented by the point R of the diagonal OR of
parallelogram OPRQ having OP and OQ as two adjacent
sides. |
(ii) Geometrical Representation of Subtraction
The representation of the difference of two complex
numbers, is slightly complicated than the addition of the
complex numbers. The easiest way of presenting the
subtraction is to think of addition ofa negative vector.


--- Page 19 ---

If we want to represent z, — z,, then the easiest way of | of \ ;
representing it would be to think of adding a negative | . 2
vector z,+ (—z,). fi \e
The negative vector is the same as the positive one, the only | / 2
difference being that the negative vector points in the V _—"4u ft -
opposite direction. . iN | :
The difference vector z, —z, is represented in the Py Py No ;
adjoining figure. * | VY |
Pe
Itis important to note here that the vector representing the difference of the vectors z,—z, may
also be drawn joining the end point of z, to the tip of z, instead of the origin, This kind of
representation does not alter the meaning or interpretation of the difference operator.
Can you think about a geometric interpretation of the addition of three or more complex
numbers? a Ey ile:
Represent sum and difference of z; = 4 + 2i and z2 = 2 + 3i graphically.

Applications of Complex Numbers
Complex numbers are used in many fields in real life. Major Fields where complex numbers are used
Electronics — Electromagnetism Computer science engineering
Civil engineering Mechanical engineering Control systems. -
In modelling and problem solving, we find many equations whose roots are complex numbers.
Dealing such kind of problems, we must have conceptual understanding of complex numbers.
Practically, negative numbers do not have square roots in the number system. However, a large
number system that contains the real number system is designed so that negative numbers do have
square roots.

Sometimes we need factorization of the equation, but in real number system in some
expressions making factors are not possible, By using the complex numbers properties, we
can make factorization possible.

The factors of z* +9 are (z-—3/)(z +31) The factors are (V3z—iN5)(V3z +i 5)

building. There are three basic things to be considered in an electrical circuit: The flow of the
electric current I, the resistance to that flow Z, called impedance, and electromotiye force E,

Saleem wants to build a swimming pool surrounded by a sidewalk of uniform width. He wants
the dimensions of the pool and sidewalk to be 16 meters by 20 meters. The pool has an area of
192 square meters. How wide should the sidewalk be?
Let x meters be the width of the sidewalk. _ 20m —_
The length of a pool is 20 — 2x meters. ef ||
The width of the pool is 16 — 2x meters. x | x |
The area of the pool can be expressed as the -
product of the length and width. ‘om |

= 4x? —72x +320
The area of the pool can be expressed as 4x” -72x+320 square meters. Since the area of the
pool is 192 square meters, replacing area with 192 results in the equation192 = 4x” —72x +320.
Saleem would probably never use a quadratic equation like 192 = 4x” —72x+320 to express
area of a pool. However, in this unit we will study many other formulas in science and business
that involve this type of equations.

Solution of Quadratic Equations
The values of variables for which an equation becomes a true sentence are called solutions or
roots of the equation. i.e. if P(a) = c, then x = a is root of the equation P(x) = c. The set of roots
of an equation is called the solution set. A quadratic equation in one variable has two roots.
These roots of the quadratic equation can be found in many ways. In this section we will study

function. Write the equation in general form like:

Notice that the function crosses the x-axis twice and the function has adegree of 2. These

Another way of solving a quadratic equation is by factoring. The factoring method depends on the
zero-product property.
Zero Product Property:
For any real number a and b, ifab=0, then eithera=QOorb=0. - 7
i. To solve the quadratic equation by factorization first write it in standard form, then
factorize the polynomial on the left-hand side of the equation.

Fr example, to solve x* = 4 by factorization we do the following steps:

Where the negative value is neglected. -
Quadratic equations can be solved in the same way.as long as one side of the equation containsa ~
perfect square. When the equation does not contain a perfect square, we can use process called
completing the square to create a perfect square. :
For an expression of the form x? + bx, we can add a constant c in the expression so that the
expression x? + bx + c is a perfect square trinomial. This process is called completing square.
Procedure
Step I: Write the equation in standard form, ‘
Step II: Shift constant term to the right hand side of the equation.
Step III: To make the left hand side a complete square; add a suitable term to both sides of
the equation. If the coefficient of x’ is 1, then it is easy to complete the square.
Just add the square of half the coefficient ofxand get acomplete square.
Step IV: Take the square root on both sides and form two linear equations.
Step V: Solve the linear equations and find roots. 3

We have learnt several ways to solve quadratic equations. Each has its limitations. The question
we think is that is there any formula that will work for any quadratic equation? The answer is
‘yes’ and the formula is called the quadratic formula. The formula is derived from solving the
general form of a quadratic equation for x.

Equation Reducible to Quadratic Form
Some equations are not quadratic, but to solve them we can reduce them to quadratic form.
The example below illustrates solving an equation that is not a quadratic equation itself, but contains
a factor that is. a quadratic. The method we use to solve the quadratic part of that equation.
Example: A cuboid box has a base that is x cm long. The width of the base is 2 cm less than its
length. The height is 3 cm greater than the length of the base. The measure of the volume is 6 times
the measure of the length of the base. Find the dimensions of the box.
Solution:
The volume of the rectangular box is the product of
the length, width and height of box.

6x = x3 +x? — 6x => x3 +x?-—12x=0 : |
x(x? +x—12)=0 => x(x —3)(x+4) =0
We use the zero-product property
x=0, x+4=0, x-3=0
x=0,x=-4,x=3
Since we are dealing with the dimensions of a box, |
we ignore 0 and —4, the solution is:
length x =3
width =x-2=3-2=|]
height = x+3=3+3=6
Hence, the dimensions of the box are 3cm* Icmx 6cm.
We have many types of equations that are not quadratic, but we can write in a form that
resembles a quadratic equation. For example, the equation 9x* —8x*-1=Ocan be written as:
9(x°)’ -8x2-1=0. Equations that can be writtemin this way are said to be equations reducible
to quadratic form.
Some of equations that can be reduced to quadratic equations, are given below,
Equations of the Form ax‘ + bx* +c = 0
It is an equation of degree 4. It can be reduced to quadratic form by using the substitution .
r= y.In this way the above equation becomes ay" +by +c = 0. Solve it by any of the three
methods discussed earlier. Replace y with its substitute x2. Find valucs of x by taking the square

Equations of the Form aP(x) + a =c
To solve this type of equation, use a substitution P(x) = y. Multiply the equation by y and form
a quadratic equation involving the variable y. Solve the new equation for y and replace y by
P(x). In this way, you will get two simple equations involving variable x. Solve these equations
and write the solution set.

Reciprocal Equations
If an equation is not affected by the replacement of a variable by its reciprocal, then it is
called a reciprocal equation. The reciprocal of a root of such an equation is also its root.

Exponential Equations
An equation involving expressions of the form 4” is called an exponential equation where k is
a constant. In exponential equations the exponents are variables. We will discuss only those
exponential equations which can be reduced to quadratic form. : ;
Exponential equations reducible to quadratic form are of the type:
ak? +bk* +c =0,a #0.
We use the substitution k* = y to reduce the above equation to quadratic form. Then we find
y and replace it with &*. In this way, roots of the exponential equations are found,
Example: Solve the following exponential equations

variable terms of both products are the same or one of them is multiple of the other. Choose a
substitute for the common terms and form a quadratic equation. Solve the new equation and
then replace the substitute. Find the values of original variable involved in the given equation

Simultaneous Equations
A system of equations having a common solution is called a system of simultaneous equations.
The set of all the ordered pairs (x, y) which satisfies the system of equations is called the solution
of the system. System of two equation involving two variables.
System of two Equations Involving two Variables
Case I: When one Equation is Linear and One Quadratic


--- Page 49 ---

If one of the equations is linear, we can find the value of one variable in terms of the other
variable from linear equation. Substituting this value-of one variable in the quadratic equation,
we can solve it. The procedure is illustrated through the following example.
Example: Solve the system of equations x+ y=7 and x’ —xyyt+y’ =13
Solution: Given Equations are re ;
, KF VSTi) Paap ty? =13..cccea(ii) |
From equation (i)
x=7-y , ,
Substituting in equation (ii)
(7-y)'-(7-y)y+-y? =13 | |
49-l4y+y?-Ty+y?+y’? =13 ,
3y’ -21y+36=0 |
| yp =-7Ty+12=0 os
y’ —4y-3y+12=0
Wy —-4)-3(y - 4) =0 .
(y-4)(y-3) =0 SO
y-4=0 or y-3=0 .
Putting y=3,in (i), we get x=7-3=4
Putting y = 4, in (i), we get x=7-4=3
Hence solutionsetis {(4, 3), (3, 4)} . :
Case II: When both of the Equations are Quadratic .
The equations in this case are classified as:
(i) Both the equations contain only x2 and y’ terms. _
(ii) One of the equations, is homogeneous in x and y, |
(iii) Both the equations are non-homogeneous.
The methods of solving these types of equations are explained through the following examples.
Example: Solve the system of equations x? + y’=25 and 2x?+3y? =66
Solution: Given equations are |
x +y=25 (i) 2x7 43y? =66 (ii)
Multiplying equation (i) by 2 and subtracting from equation (ii). : .
2x" +3y? = 66
+2x?+2y? =50 |
Putting y’=16 in equation (i) . ’


--- Page 50 ---

_ _  . _ i;|._~_  §£ ££  ## # # # # #§#§#§. .§.§ i... »_ee
x =9
Now from x’? =9, we have x=+3
and from y =16, we have y=+4
Hence, solutionsetis {(+3, +4)}
Example:
Solve the system of equations x’ + y? =20 and 6x’ +xy—y" =0
Solution:
Given equations are
x+y? = 20 (i)
6x° +xy—y’ =0 (ii)
| From equation (ii)
) ~y' +xy +6x" =0 :
. y -—xy- 6x" -=0
y? —3xy + 2x 6x? =0
yy — 3x) +2x(y —32x) = 0
(y—3x)(y+2x)=0
y-3x=0 or y+2x=0
y =3x..2.(iii) y= —2x.....fi¥)
Putting y =3x in (i) ) Putting = —2x in (i)
x? +(3x)y° = 20 x? +(-2x)? =20
x° +9x" =20 x? +4x? =20
. 10x* = 20 5x* =20.
x’ =2 x=4
x=tV2 , ro42
When x=2 When x=2
From (iii) ” y=3V2 From (iv) ~ xe’
When x=—V2, When x=-2
From (iii) y= 3/2 From (iv) y=4
Hence, solution set is {(2, 3/2), (V2, —3V2), (2, -4), (-2, 4)}

Real Problems Involving Quadratic Equations
There are many problems which lead to quadratic equations. To form an equation, we consider
symbols for unknown quantities in the problems.
In order to solve problems, we must have
(i) Suppose the unknown quantities to bex ory. ‘
(ii) ‘Translate the problem into symbols and form the equation satisfying the conditions,
The method of solvin g the problem will be il lustrated through the following examples.
Example: The length of a room is 3 meters greater than its breadth. Ifthe area of the room is
180 square meters, find length and breadth of the room.
Solution:, Let the breadth of room = x metres
and the length of room = x + 3 metres ‘0, .
Area of the room = x (x + 3) square metres . |
By the conditions of the equation .
x(x+3)=180 . or x?+3x-—180=0
(x+15})(x-12)=0 or x =-15,x =12
As breadth cannot be negative, therefore, we take x = 12.
Length = x+3=12+3=15

Since number of columns of B = 1, but number of rows in A = 2.
So, product BA is not possible.
A)
* In multiplication, the first matrix contributes its number of rows and the second matrix
contributes its number of columns, in the resultant matrix. i.e. If order of matrix A is m-by-n
and order of matrix B is n-by-p, then order of AB is m-by-p.
¢ If A and B are two matrices which are conformable for product AB then B and A are not
necessarily confirmable for product BA.

When a matrix has m rows and n columns, it is called an “‘ m-by-n” matrix and is also called
dimensions of a matrix. If a matrix has the same number of rows and columns, it is called a square
matrix. With every square matrix is associated a number called its determinant, defined as follows °

find the solution of linear equations in two or more variables. However, our study at this level is
confined to the solution of simultaneous linear equations only in two variables.

This equation indicates that the values of the variables in the matrix X are equal to the

As, |A| =|? ‘| = 35 — 12 = 23 + 0, so inverse is possible,

~ OO Applications of Matrices
The most difficult part of solving a problem in algebra is almost always translating the problem
situation to mathematical language. Once an equation is translated, the rest is usually
straightforward. In this section, we study systems of equations and how to solve them using
matrices. We can use matrices to help us solve problems that involve. systems of equations. Using
matrices often simplifies the process of solving these systems. . |
Example: .
Anas bought 3 cream puffs and 5 pringle packs paying Rs.650. Abid bought 4 cream puffs and 2
pringle packs paying Rs. 400. Find how much each item costs? (Hint: Either matrix inversion
method or Cramer’s rule can be used).
Solution: _
Let x be the cost of a cream puff and y be the cost of 4 pringle pack, then Anas’s shopping is
represented by 3x + 5y= 650 and Abid’s shopping is represented by equation 4x + 2y = 400
Writing in matrix equation
3 5) [x] .. 7650) | y=
hi 2 | “€ [tool or = AX=B Ry
Now by using Cramer’s rule
D=|Al=|{ 3|=6-20=~-14
D, = | 400 | = 1300 — 2000 = -700, Dy | 1 1001 1200 — 2600 = —1400
Now, x = = and y = “ -
x= 2 and y= => x=50° and y= 100 ,
So, each cream puff costs Rs, 50 and each pringle pack costs Rs. 100.
Example: &
Naveed is a chemist who is preparing an acid solution to be used as a cleaner for machine parts.
The machine shops need several batches of 200 ml of solution at a 48% concentration. He only
has 60% and 40% concentration solutions. The two solutions can be combined to make the 48%
solution. How much of each solution should Naveed use to make 200 ml of solution?
Solution: . )
Let x represent the amount of 60% solution and let y represent the amount of 40% solution.
x+y=200 The total of two amount must be 200 ml.

Graph of Inequality
On a number line, the graph of an inequality in one variable is the set of points that represents
all solutions of the inequality. To graph an inequality in one variable, we use open circle for the
symbols ‘<’ or ‘>’ and a closed circle for the symbols ‘<’ or ‘>’. .

Solving Quadratic Inequalities ;
We will discuss the solution of quadratic inequalities in one variable. Quadratic inequalities can
be derived from quadratic equations. The word ‘Quadratic’ comes from the word ‘Quadratum’
' which means square in Latin. From this, we can define quadratic inequalities on second degree
equation. The general form of a quadratic equation is ax” +bx+c =0. Further if the quadratic
polynomial ax’?+bx+c is not equal to zero, then they are either ax’+hx+c>0 or
. ax’ +bx+c<0 and are called quadratic inequalities. We explain quadratic inequalities with
daily life example. .
Consider a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 64 feet per second.
The function h(t) = 64 t — 16 t? gives the height of the ball after ) rts
t seconds. During what time span is the ball in flight? We can find ' *; ,
the times that the ball is in flight by solving the inequality ; :
64t—16t?>0. |» ¢ ‘|
64t — 16t? > 0 P | : i
—16t* + 64t > 0 |
—16t(t-—4) >0 VA Z |
This inequality shows that the product of two numbers is positive Rte
if both of the numbers (-16r, t—4) are positive or both are negative.
Case I: Case II: |
When both numbers are positive | When both numbers are negative
-l6t>0 and r-4>0 —l6t<0 and ¢-4<0
_t<0 and t>4 t>0 and t<4
Here, t< 0 and at the same time t > 4 Means: 0<f and 1<4
is never true. 2 eae: O<tr<4
The solution set is {0 < t < 4}. So, the ball is in flight between 0 and 4 seconds after it is thrown.
Example; Solve x’-4x-12>0 ° | .
Solution: x? —4x—-12>0
/ x*—6x+2x-12>0 => x(x-6)+2(x-6)>0 :
=> § (x-6)(x+2)50 |
Another way that you can solve quadratic inequalities is by using three test points. }
First solve the equation (x—6)(x+2)=0 - ‘
x-6=0o0rx+2=0.
=> x=6,x=-2
These solutions are called critical points. The points —2 and 6 separate the x-axis into three
regions:-x<-—2, -2<x<6, x>6.

Suppose you and your friend, each live in the same street as your school, but on opposite sides
of the school. You each live 6 km from the school. What can you say about your trips to school
each day? Do you each travel the same distance?
Consider placing both houses and the school on a number line with the school at the origin. .
Your home is located at 6, and your friend is located at —6. ‘
Certainly, —6. and 6 are quite different but they do have something in common. They have the
same distance from 0 on the number line. This means that you and your friend travel the same
distance, but in different direction, when you go to school.
: 6 units _ 6 units
We say that —6 and 6 have the same absolute value. The absolute value of a number is the
number of units it is from 0 in the number line. |
We use the symbol |x| to represent the absolute value of a number x.
The absolute value of 6 is |6|=6, and absolute value of —6. is |-6|=6. |
i — For any real number x
| | e If x20, then |x|=x _?
Absolute value L—, e If x>0,then |x|=-x |

In words: The definition states that the absolute value of a non-negative is the number itself and
the absolute value of a negative number is the opposite of the number.
Since distance is always non-negative, we can think of a number’s absolute value as its distance
from zero on number line.

Inequalities With Absolute Value
The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line. We can use this idea
to solve inequalities involving absolute value.
Example: Solve |x| < 5. .
Solution: |x|<5S means that the distance between x and 0 is less than five units. To make jx]<5
true, we must substitute the values of x that are less than five units from 0.
6 4932 4 1 2 4 5 6
All the number between — 5 and 5 are less than 5 units from zero.
The absolute solution set = {|x|:—5 < x < 5}.
_ Example: Solve|x| 23... Graph the solution. .
Solution: The solution of |x| 23. are those numbers whose distance from 0 is greater than or
equal to 3. In other words, those numbers x such that x<—3 or x23. The solution set is

- Solving Systems of Linear Inequalities |
A system of linear inequalities in two variables or simply a system of inequalities consists of
two or more linear inequalities in the same variable. As:
x-y>9 Inequality I } kk .
2x+y<9 Inequality I
A solution of a system of linear inequalities is an ordered pair that is a solution of each
inequality in the system. For example, (7, — 6) is a solution of the system A. .
The graph of a system of linear inequalities is the graph of all solutions of the system.

Kinds of Algebraic Expressions
Algebraic expressions are of three kinds. .- ) '
. Polynomial Expressions —_
° Rational Expressions .
° Irrational Expressions ;
Polynomials are algebraic expressions consisting of one or more terms in which exponents of
the variables involved are non-negative (either zero or positive) integers.
For example: |
0, -2, 2x +3 yz, -fey. V2x* —nx?— 10 ete.
The expressions x~°, yr, a/y* , 2y? are not polynomials because their exponents are
not non negative integers (whole numbers). _
Polynomial with respect to [_ SS


--- Page 99 ---

} (a) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Terms , ns
e A polynomial having one term is called a monomial. e.g., 3, x, 0 etc. ;
« A polynomial having two terms is called a binomial. :
. eg. at+b,2x+y, 7ab— ; » xi+ 2 etc,
¢ A polynomial having three terms is called a trinomial.
e.g. x7+2xy+yp?, ; x+ ax 9 etc.
_ All other polynomials having more than three non- zero terms are called polynomials of four
‘terms, five terms, six terms and so on.
When a polynomial is written in descending order, then the first coefficient is called
the leading coefficient. e.g., in p(x) = 3x‘ — 2x? + 1, the leading coefficient is 3.
Here p(x) means that the variable in the polynomial is ‘x’.
(b) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Degree
> Zero polynomial or no degree polynomial:
“0” is called a polynomial of no degree. Also, 0x? + Ox.is a no degree polynomial,
because coefficients are always zero in zero polynomial. .
> Constant polynomial: '
A polynomial having degree zero is called a constant polynomial. eg. 2,—5, > V5
are all constant polynomials. |
>» Linear polynomial: 4
A polynomial having degree one is called a linear polynomial. e.g., x, 2x-y, — Txy* etc.
| _» Quadratic polynomial: A polynomial having degree two is called a quadratic ;
polynomial. e.g., 2x?+7, ax + 2xy + 3-2 ay" etc, ,
> Cubic polynomial: oo . .
_ A polynomial having degree three is called a cubic polynomial. e.g. 9 -— Tx + 5,
Oxzy, 3x*y — - z ete.
All other polynomials have no specific name w.r.t. degree but simply, we call them
polynomials of degree four, degree five and so on. '
(c) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Coefficients .
~ Polynomials can also be classified according to the coefficients of the variables involved in
each term of them. e.g., —3x? + 4x — 1 is a polynomial with integers co-efficients because
—3,4,-leZ. .


--- Page 100 ---

— a 1 5 9 22, oe 22
_ Similarly, ri yr-ax y+ isa polynomial with real numbers because > —H, = eR.
Just like this we can also check the coefficients in any polynomial and classify it accordingly.
(d) Types of Polynomials w.r.t. Variables
Classification of polynomials is also possible with respect to the variables involved in them.
e.g., xy — 7 is a polynomial in two variables x , y. We can express it as
Similarly, 6x°yz + 12 xy*z° + 9z* is a polynomial in three variables x , y, z. We may write it
as Q (x, y , Z) = Gx? yz + 12 xy°z° + 924,
Recall a
The highest exponent of the variable involved in a: polynomial is called its degree. If more
- than one variable are being multiplied in terms of a polynomial. Then the degree of that
polynomial is the sum of exponent ofall the variables present in a term. .
(b) Rational Expression —_.
An algebraic expression of the form th »where P(x)and Q(x) are polynomials and Q(x) # 0
O(x)
(i.e. it is not a zero polynomial) is called a rational expression.

Basic Operations on Algebraic Fractions
Operations with rational numbers and rational algebraic expressions are very similar, A
_ ‘ational number can be expressed as the quotient \of two integers. A rational algebraic
expression can be expressed as the quotient of two polynomials. In either case, the
denominator can never be 0. .

Another method for simplifying a complex rational expression involves first adding or
subtracting, as necessary, to get one rational expression in the numerator and one rational
expression in the denominator. The problem is thereby simplified to one involving the
division of two expressions. .

- Solving Rational Equations
An equation that contains one or more rational expressions is called a rational equation. Here
"are some examples:
2, x 1 x-4 6. #x7F a5
S-=s-, 2-04 229
5.4 x: x+lo x-2 x+l x
Equations of this type occur frequently in applications. It is easiest to solve a rational equation ,
if the fractions are eliminated. This can be done by multiplying each side of the equation by
the least common denominator (LCD). Remember that when you multiply each side by the
LCD, each term on each side must be multiplied by the LCD.

in a denominator of zero. When solving rational equations, we check that for solution

excluded from list of solutions.

Cartesian product of any two non-empty sets A and B denoted by A x B (read as A cross B) is a
set containing all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x € A and y e B. We can write it as:

AXB= {(x,y)|xe AA yeB}
For example, if A = {a, b} and B = {2}, then _° + Ifn(A)=p and n(B) =,
All the subsets of A x B are: — : Ch ED om
Ri={}, Ro= {(a,2)}, Ra= {(b,2)} and R4= {(a, 2), (b, 2)}
Any subset of the cartesian product AxB is called a binary relation(or simply a relation) from set
A to set B. Basically, a binary relation relates an element of one set to an element of the other set.
All the above four subsets are binary relations from set A to set B,
Domain of any relation R denoted by dom(R) is a set containing first element of each ordered pair
in the relation. Dom(R,) = {a, b}
Range of a relation R denoted by ran(R) is a set containing second element of each ordered pair in
the relation, Ran(R,) = {2}
In R,, 2 is image of a and b but.a and b are preimages of 2

Function
A function f from set A to set B is a relation, rule or mapping which maps each element of set A
to a unique element of set B such that domain of f= A and there is no repetition in the first element
of ordered pairs in f.
Mathematically, it is written as f: A > B and is read.as fis a function from A to B.
In the above example in which A = {a, b} and’B = {2}, : a —
Consider R, = {(a, 2), (b, 2)}, f ~

Therefore, R, is a function. Na a,
The first element of each ordered pair in Ry is called pre-image while
its corresponding second element is called image of the first element. Ry, Re and R3 are not:
In (a, 2), a is the pre-image of 2 and 2 is the image of a. functions. Justify.
Domain of a Function
A set containing first element of each ordered pair in the function is called its domain.
Range of a Function :
A set containing second element of each ordered pair in the function is called its range.
If f is a function from set A to set B, i.e., f: A+B, then Bis called co-domain of f and range
of fis a subset of co-domain.

Solution: A= {l, 2,3} , B= {2,3} Do you agree?
Here fis a subset of A x B and dom f= {1, 2,3} =A.
. Also, there is no repitition in the first element of the ordered pairs in f, therefore f is a function.

Solution: Here f, g and h are functions asthe domain of each of them is equal to their
corresponding first set and no first element is repeated in their respective mapping.
But in mapping t, dom(t) # P( 2 has no image in set Q) and there is repetition of 0 (~ it is mapped
to two elements 7 and 9 of Q), therefore t is not a function.
_ Inmapping p, dom(p) # L (~ b has no image in set M), so.p is not a function.
In mapping q, although dom(q) = S but b is repeated (~- it is the pre-image of two elements 2 and
3 of T), therefore q is not a function.
Types of Functions -
Range of a function is required for identifying the type of a function.

Dom(Rz2) = {2,3,5} =A and there is no repitition in the first element of the ordered pairs in Rp,

Range(R3) = {i, 0, u}¢ B which implies that R; is an into function. Also, there is no repitition in
the second element of the ordered pairs in R3, so R3 is one-one function.
Hence, R3 is an.injective function. :

Evaluating a Function
A function is usually written as y = f(x), in which the values of y (dependent variable) depends
upon the values of x (independent variable) and is as ‘y is a function of x’ or simply y is equal
to f of x’.
Evaluation of a function is a process of finding the value of dependent variable by substituting any
specific value of the independent variable.
Example: Find the value of f(x) = —2x3 + x? at: :
() {(-1) (il) f(t) di) dy) +2)
Solution: (1) Substituting x = —1 in f(x) = —2x3 + x?, we have
f(—1)= —2(—1)? + (—1)? = —2(-1) + 1 =3
(il) Replacing x by t in f(x), we have
f(t) = —2(t)? + (¢)? = —2¢3 + t?
(iff) Substituting x= = in f(x), we have

Operations on Functions
Operations on functions are the ways of combining functions to create new functions. Some
common operations on any two functioris f(x) and g(x) are:
(i) Addition of functions: (f+ g)( x) = f(x) + g(x).
For example, if f(x) = x? and g(x) = 2x, then
(£+ g)( x) = fx) + g(x) =x? + 2x : ,
(ii) Subtraction of functions: (f — g)( x) = f(x) — g(x).
For example, if f(x) = 2x* + 3x and p(x) = x? — 2x , then,
(f — g)( x) = f(x) — g(x) = (2x? + 3x) —(x? — 2x)
=2x* 43x —x2 + 2x =x? + 5x ot
(iii) Multiplication of functions: (fx g)( x) = f(x) x g(x). ;
For example, if f(x) =x? and g(x) = —2x, then (f x g)(x) = f(x) x g(x) |
=x" x (—2x) =—2x3
(iv) Division of functions: (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) , where e(x)* 0
For example, if f(x) = x? and g(x) = 2x, then (f + g)(x) = f(x)-+g(x)
Z
=x? +(2x)== ==
(v) | Composition of functions: The composition of f(x) and g(x) is a function denoted by fog
and is defined as:
(fog)( x) = f(g(x))
_ For example, if f(x) = x? and g(x) = 2x —1, then:
(fog)( x)= f(ge(x)) = f(2x —1) = (2x -—1)? = 4x? —4x41
_ Inother words, the output of inner function g(x) will become the input of the outer function
f(x). , -
—_ In this example, we first applied the function g to x, which resulted in 2 x — 1, then applied
the function f to the result which gave us (2x — 1)?.
Furthermore, for finding (gof)( x), f(x) will be the input of the outer function g(x).
So, (gof)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x?) = 2x? — 1
* — (fog)(x) and (gof)(x) can simply be written as_fg(x) and gf (x) respectively.

--- Page 122 ---

saving after 10 weeks. Also, tell in how many weeks he will be able to save the money for getting
a new bike?
Solution: Aahil’s saving function: S(x) = 12000 + 1000x , where x represents number of weeks
His spending function: T(x) = 500x
Total money with Aahil after x weeks = S(x) — T(x)
= 12000 + 1000x — 500x = 12000 + 500x
After 10 weeks, saving with Aahil = 12000 + 500(10) = 17000 rupees
Now, 24000 = 12000 + 500x =>24000 - 12000 = 500x => x =" = 24
Hence, he can save required amount in 24 weeks. -
Inverse of a Function
The inverse of any function f(x) is a function denoted by f~(x) which reverses the effect of f(x)
and it undoes what f(x) does, If: X — Y, then f~?: Y > X, therefore inverse of only that function
exists which is bijective(both one-one and onto).
Thus, if y =/(x) Vx € X, thenx = f~1(y) V y & Y. It can be illustrated in the following diagram
as :
X(Domainoff) Y (Range of f)

X (Range of f-") ¥ (Domaht'off”") AF -*@)) = F* FD) = x
: fo)
It is clear from above diagram that domain of f= range of f~1 and range of f= domain of f~'.
Finding the Inverse of an Algebraic Function
If f(x) is any algebraic function, then its inverse f—?(x) involves the following steps:
lL Write y=/(x) |
Il. Find the value of x in terms of y from the equation of step I, means write x in terms of y.
III. Replace x by f~1(y) in the resulting equation of step II.
IV. . Replace each y by x in the resulting equation of step III to get f-*(@).
The result obtained in step IV can be verified by showing f~*(f(x)) = x.
Example: If f: RR is defined by f(x) = 3x +3 , find f—1(x).
Solution: Writing f(x) = y, we have,
y=3x+5
3x =y— 1-97 3 y= 2 (Isolating x)

y-intercept for getting two points. | , . y-intercept |

The point where the graph intersects y-axis is (0, 3).
From the graph, it is clear that this line does not pass through origin. We can find the coordinates
of any point on the graph just by taking its distance from the axis.

Substituting x = 120, P(120)=|2 x 120 — 100] = 140
Thus, the company makes a profit of 140 rupees.

First convert phase angle to radians as under:
Phase angle = 30° x = radians = - radians
Now substitute x = = in the given function,

For example, y = x? — 2x —3 , y=—4x? +1 are quadratic functions. ,
The graph of a quadratic function is a'U-shaped curve called parabola that opens either upward (if
a > 0) or downward (if a < 0). .

The vertical line passing through the vertex of parabola is called ‘axis of symmetry’ as the graph
is symmetrical about y-axis.
In order to sketch the graph of such quadratic functions, follow the following steps.
Step-2: Find x-intercept and y-intercept.
Step-3: Find the vertex of the parabola.
For finding vertex of the parabola, we proceed as follows:
y =ax*+bx+c

is the turning point of the graph. The curve is symmetrical about the line x = h.
To sketch the graph of parabola, we’draw its vertex , x- and y-intercepts and some other points to
get a smooth curve.
Example:
Sketch the graph of y = x? — 2x —3. a

Real Life Problems Related to Functions and Graphs
Graphs and functions are essential: tools in various aspects of daily life. They have wide
applications often unconsciously in solving many real life problems including distance and time,
supply and demand, ‘temperature and time, population growth, health and fitness, weather
forecasting, financial planning, time management, medical research, environmental monitoring,
fitness tracking etc. By applying graphs and functions to daily life problems, we can develop a
more analytical approach to decision making and problem solving.
Here are some problems involving functions and their graphs.

Introduction of Vectors
There are two main types of physical quantities used in Physics, Mathematics and
Engineering. They are known as, ‘scalers’ and ‘vectors’
Scalar |
A physical quantity that possesses magnitude only, is called a scalar quantity. It can be
completely specified by a number along with unit. For example, mass, time, speed, density,
work, distance, length, perimeter, area, volume, etc.
Vector :
A physical quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction, is called a vector quantity.
For example, weight, displacement, momentum, force, velocity, acceleration, electric field
etc.

terminal point with the arrow head denoted by AB.

Position Vector .
The vector used to specify the position of a point P with respect to ans Pp

Rectangular or Cartesian Coordinate System
A rectangular or Cartesian coordinate system consists of -_
two number lines which are mutually perpendicular. B}--------¢ PG y)
Their point of intersection is called the origin, usually =A
denoted by the letter ‘O’. Horizontal line is called x-axis x = | 7
and vertical line is called y-axis. Ordered pairs of numbers o A ants
can be represented on a Cartesian plane, which is sometimes |
called the Coordinate plane or xy-plane. Each point in the
plane corresponds to an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers + yraxis
x and y, called the coordinates of the point.
Cartesian plane has got this name after the French mathematici an Rene Descartes
(1596 — 1650). He developed the idea of the coordinate plane and the correspondence
 -of ordered pairs of numbers to’ points in the coordinate plane. Each point in the plane
can corresponds to only one ordered pair and vice versa.

Vector in a Plane
Let R be the set of real numbers, then the Cartesian plane is defined as:
R? = {(x, y): x, y ER} y-axis
Any point P(x, y) is uniquely determined by its coordinates +
x and y. For a given vector U in the plane, there exists a unique P(x, y)
point P(x, y) in the plane such that: | ui”

For the point P(x, y), a unique ordered pair [x, y] is used for [Fal ee
the vector i called position vector of P(x, y). Thus: (0,0) x-axis
Negative of a Vector .
A vector having the same magnitude but opposite in direction of a —
given vector b is called the negative of b and is denoted by —b. es |
If u = [x, y], then negative vector of i is defined as: —

P(3, — 4) is a point in the plane, Find the position vector OP and then its negative vector.
Solution:
Given is P(3, — 4) in the plane.
Position vector of P = OP = [3, —4] :
Negative vector of OP = —OP =- (3, -4] =[-3,4] "°
Zero or Null Vector
If the initial and terminal points of a vector coincide then the vector has zero length.
This vector is called zero vector and is denoted by 0. The zero vector has no direction. So, it
. can be assigned as convenient direction according to the situation. The zero vector is denoted
0 =[0, 0]

Unit Vector .
A vector which is in the direction ofa non-zero vector % and has magnitude | is called a unit
vector of # and is denoted by fi. If % is non-zero vector of arbitrary length |i| then:
fag > i=|te
This mean any vector i can be constructed by multiplying the magnitude of the vector to its
unit vector. The process of finding the unit vector of a vector ii is called normalizing the
vector i.
If ti = [x, y], then its unit vector is written as:

Translation by Vector
Translation by a vector is‘a process that moves a point or figure in space by a given vector.
It is a type of transformation that slides a figure without rotating it, so the shape, size, and
orientation of the figure do not change. .
Geometrically :
Place the tail of the arrow at the point, and the translated point is at the head of the arrow.
Algebraically
Represent the points and the vector by their coordinates. The translation vector's coordinates
indicate how far to move the points along each coordinate axis. .
For example, the vector [a, b] moves points a units horizontally and b units vertically.
For example, a translation vector that moves a figure aT 4
4 units right and 2 units down can be represented | | i !
mathematically as [4, —2] , or graphically as shown in a] |
the adjoining figure. It doesn’t matter where the vector +——— = ———;
is positioned in the plane. In this figure, the vector starts | |
at (—2, 2) and ends at (2, 0). But the initial point and | | i > | [
terminal point of the vector is irrelevant. What matters 7 + K-94 2 4
is the length of the vector and the direction in which it | | | |
points, so all you have to look at is how many units the — <2} —__;—___.
vector moves in the y-direction and how many units the | ; | |
vector moves in the x-direction,

Parallel Vectors f
Two non-zero vectors ii and @ are said to be parallel if i = Av, il :
where A is a scalar. If A > 0 then both vectors have the same Fe
direction and if A < 0 then both are in the opposite direction. —_____»
The vectors which are in the opposite direction are known as anti-parallel vectors.
In component form, when i = [x1,-yi].and @ = [x2, y2] are parallel vectors, then:
=> [x, yi] = [Ax Ay2] => x1 =Ax2 and yi =Ay2
Example:
Prove that @ = [—12, —15] and b= (4, 5] are parallel vectors.
Solution: Given that @ = [-12, -15] and b = [4, 5] ,
a = [-12, -15] =-3[4, 5] =—3b
As d is scaler multiple of b, therefore di | B.
Equal Vectors |
Two vectors i and ¥ are said to be equal if both have the a .
same magnitude and direction. 3
If vectors if and @ are equal then we write Z = v. yo
If i = [x1, yi] and @ = [x2, y2], then i = @ implies that:
Ia yj=pa2y] = xx arid -yi = y2
e It is not necessary for the equal vectors to have the same position.
e Geometrically two vectors are equal if they are translation of one another.
© If in the relation d = Ab and A =1 then a = b.
© Equal vectors are also parallel.

: Addition of Vectors
Head to Tail Rule . _
To add non-zero vectors # and q join the tail of the second vector q with the head of the first
vector J. Now the-vector obtained by joining the tail of the first vector to the head of the
- second vector is the vector j + q called the resultant vector of p and q.
This method for the addition of two vectors is called head to tail rule of addition. Since p,q
and p + q are along the sides of a triangle XYZ, so this method of addition of vectors is also
known as triangle law of addition. a:
Parallelogram Law of Addition :
Consider any parallelogram PQRS. Let PQ = p and QR = q. 5 p R
. Since the vector QR has the same magnitude and direction as dy ‘a oe - oo |
that of PS. Similarly, SR has the same magnitude and y, fs ar a “g
direction as that PQ. Therefore: Pp B 4
PO = SR and QR =PS | }
Using triangle law of addition, we have:
PQ+QR=PR .
=> p+qG=PR
Showing that the diagonal vector PR of the parallelogram is the sum of the vectors of p and q.
This is known as parallelogram law of addition. Furthermore:
From APQR, PR=$+q (i) 2

Polygon Law of Vector Addition
The process for the addition of vectors can be extended to any number of vectors. For
instance, let we have four vectors d, b,@,d_ and we need to find their sum.
From the figure,
OA=4d, AB= b, BC =¢, CD=d PD
Now d+ b+2+ d=O0A+AB+BC+CD / d
= (0A + AB)+BC+CD J we:
=0C+CD (+ 0B +BC =0C) | Zl
=OD *) a A
Here, OD is the sum of all these four vectors. The same method is adopted to find the sum of
any number of vectors, This method is called polygon law of addition of vectors.
Explanation: If ti = [x1, yi] and 0 = [x2, y2], W = [>3, ys], then:
i++ W = [xy yi] + [x2, y2] + bes, y3] = [er + x2 +23, yi + y2t ys]
Example:
if a =[4, 6] and b =[-3, 1], ¢= [2 ,-2) then find d + 2b + 2. Also find |@ + 2b + ¢l.
Solution:
Given that, @ = [4,6], b = [-3,1] and ¢ = [2,-2]
Now, d+ 2b +@=[4,6] + 2[-3,1] + [2,-2]=14,6] + [-6,2] + [2,-2]
|a + 2b + |= V0? + 6? = V36 = 6units
Subtraction of Two Vectors
To subtract a vector, form the other we find the negative vector of the vector to be subtracted
and then add it to the other vector.
Consider two non-zero vectors i and v then: | a ‘ je /

. ui—-t=iu+(—v). : Jf -(_-—v
From the figure, AB = i and BC = —@; then | /
AB+BC=AC (head to tail rule of addition) 3

i+ (8) =a-8 = AC \4 ——r"
Thus, AC is the vector which represents ti — B. i F \ oe | *
In component form, if = [x1, yi] and @ = [x2, y2}, then: rane
i — i =([m, yi] — [2, y2] C
= [x1 — x2, yi — y2]

Example:
If = [7, 10] and b = [-3, 10], then find @ — B and a unit vector along a — B.
Solution: co
Given that, @=[7, 10] and b =[-3, 10] By) eo

Representation of a Vector in Cartesian Plane
We denote the unit vector along x-axis by 7 and along y-axis
y-axis by f. ‘
Let us consider a point P(x, y) in the Cartesian plane- | AP(x,y)
We want to find the position vector OP in terms of unit a ie |
vectors f and f. 4 yj
Draw perpendicular from P on x-axis meeting the x-axis fp
at point A. As we knew that for any vector i: O40, » xi y" oe
i= mi OF u = [ua ,
i.e., Every vector is equal to the product of magnitude with its unit vector, So,
OA = |OAlt = xt
AP = |AP|j = yj ,
Now, OP = OA + .
=> OP=xi+ yj
=> Fr=xityy. -
This is the position vector of the point P(x, y) lying in the Cartesian plane.

What type of a quadrilateral ABCD is if 2AB = DC? |


--- Page 156 ---

Solution: D c
2AB = DC implies that: \ /
2|AB| = |[DC| and AB {| DC \ /
These two conditions show that ABCD is a trapezium. B
Example:
A(x, y), B(-2, 3), C(—3, — 4) and D(4, —5) are vertices of a D c
parallelogram taken in order. Use vector method to find vertex A. / /
Position vectors of vertices of parallelogram are: / /

OC=-3t-4j, OD=4t-Sj

DC = OC — OD = (-31 - 4) = (40 — 5f) = (-3 — 4) + (4 + 5)f=—78+j
As, ABCD is a parallelogram, therefore:
AB=DC => (-2-x)i+-—y)j=-7its
=> —2i-xi+3f-—yf=-7i+f => —2i+7i2+3j7—j =xi+yj ,
=> Si+2f =xi+yj => x=5,y=2
.. Fourth vertex of parallelogram is A(5, 2).

Oblique Triangles
An oblique triangle is any triangle that is not a right triangle. It could be an acute triangle or it
could be an obtuse triangle. ,
) Acute Triangle Obtuse Triangle

The Pythagoras Theorem along with trigonometric ratios allow us to easily handle any given
right triangle problem, but what if the triangle is not a right triangle i.e. the triangle is
oblique?
To solve oblique triangles, we use certain laws known as “law of cosines”, “law of sines” and
“Tawnof tangents’ Law of Cesines
When we know the measures of two sides and the included angle of a triangle (SAS), the size
and shape of the triangle are determined. Therefore, we should be able to find the measure of
the third side of the triangle. Sometimes three sides of oblique triangles are given (SSS) and
we have to find the three angles of triangle. Such cases are easily handled by using law of
cosines.
Statement: .
If a, b, c are three sides and a, 8, are three angles of an oblique triangle with usual notation,
then law of cosines is stated as follows:

a’ =b’ +c? —2becosa ....... (1)

b? =a’ +c? —2accosf ........(2)

c* =a’ +b? —2abcosy..........(3)

Law of Sines
Law of cosines is not applicable when two angles and one side (AAS or ASA) or one angle
and two sides (angle not included (SSA)) of an oblique triangle are given. In order to handle
such situation, we use another law known as “law of sines”.
Statement:
If a, 6, c are three sides and a, 8, y are three angles of an oblique triangle with usual notation,
then law of sines is stated as follows:

(i) If a+ <180°, there is only one AABC.

Half Angle Formulae

Circles Connected with Triangles
(a) Circumcircle
A circle passing through the vertices of any triangle (polygon) iscalled circumcircle.
The centre of this circle is called the circumcentre and its radius is called the circumradius.
The radius of circumcircle is denoted by R.
A circle drawn inside and touching the sides of a triangle (polygon) is called incircle or
inscribed circle. It is the largest circle contained in the triangle. The centre of this circle is
called the incentre usually denoted by I and its radius is called the inradius denoted by r.
(c) Escribed Circle
A circle touching one of the sides of a triangle externally and the extensions of its two other
sides internally, is called an escribed circle (e-circle or ex-circle). The centre of this circle is
called the e-centre and its radius is called the e-radius.
If a circle touches extended arms of angle A (circle is drawn opposite to vertex A) of a
triangle ABC, then its centre and radius are respectively denoted by I; and r1. Similarly,
(i) Centre and radius of e-circle opposite to vertex B are denoted by I: and rz.

In this topic, we will learn about 3-D trigonometry. We will use combined knowledge of
Pythagoras’ theorem, trigonometric ratios, the law of sines (sine rule) and the law of cosines
(cosine rule) to find missing angles and sides of triangles in 3-dimensional shapes.

Circle theorems are statements in geometry that state important results related to circles that are
used to solve various questions in geometry. They have very useful applications within design and
engineering.
These theorems show relationships between angles within the geometry of a circle. We can use
these theorems along with prior knowledge of other angle properties to calculate missing angles,
without the use of a protractor. _ ~ ¢

Tangents have several important applications across various fields, particularly in mathematics, physics,

engineering, and geometry. Some applications of tangents are:

* Tangents play an important role in the study of curves. They are lines that touch a curve at a single point,
perpendicular to the curve's radius at that point. Tangents are used to define geometric properties such as the
radius, diameter, chord, and arc length of circles.

* Tangents are used to design curves in buildings, such as arches and domes.

* Tangents are used to design curves in roads, bridges, and other structures. By using tangents, engineers can
create curves that are safe and efficient for travel.

* Tangents are used to analyse the motion of objects. For example, whena car or bike travels down a road, the
road becomes tangent at each location where the wheels roll. )

Solution:
(i) ZPOQ=100° (Central angle)
As, 2ZPSQ is angle subtended by the corresponding major arc.
= ZPSQ = 50° A cyclic trapezium is
(ii) APQS is isosceles with OP = OQ = radii. Therefore: isosceles and its diagonal
ZOPQ + ZOQP + ZPOQ = 180° | bisect each other. ;
= 2Z0PQ + 100° = 180° (ZOPQ = ZOQP) jf \
=> ZOPQ=80°+2=40° X 7
(iii) PQRS is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore:

e Apply concepts of practical geometry of circles to real life word problems such as athletic tracks,
~, recreational parks, Ferris wheels and mechanical machines. ff
A circle is symmetric about its centre and any of its diameters. Architects often use the
circle's symmetrical properties when designing athletic tracks, recreational parks, buildings,
roundabouts, Ferris-wheels, etc. Artists and painters find the circle almost indispensable in
their work. Circular cylinders are used to print newspapers. Engineers exploit the circle's |
symmetrical properties as seen by the use of the circle in making watches, clocks, bicycles,
cars, trains, ships, aero-planes, radios, telephones, trolleys, wheel-barrows, air-conditioners,
rockets etc. Civilizations have progressed dramatically because of the invention of the
circular wheel. : .

Frequency Distribution

In statistics it is very important to represent a data in a manageable way so that it becomes easy
to understand, analyze and to draw useful results. This useful presentation of data can be made
by various methods. Grouped frequency distribution is one of the most important methods to
represent the quantitative data. Data can be classified in many ways for efficient usage and ,
productivity. In previous grades we have discussed two types of data

i. raw data (ungrouped data) ii. grouped data (frequency distribution)

Here we will study the construction of cumulative frequency distribution by revising frequency
polygon. , .

Frequency Polygon

Polygon is a many sided closed figure. To draw a frequency polygon mid points (class marks)
are marked on the horizontal axis and frequencies are marked on the vertical axis., Points are
plotted with class frequencies and their corresponding class marks. These points are joined by
straight line segments. To complete a closed polygon we add extra classes at both ends with zero
frequencies. In this way two extra points on x-axis are obtained on both ends. The points are
joined by their nearer plotted points. Finally a frequency polygon is obtained.

Cumulative Frequency Distribution
A table in which cumulative frequencies of classes are written against classes is called a
cumulative frequency table “The number of values of a data less than an upper-class boundary is
called its cumulative frequency”.

The cumulative frequency table is another way to analyze the frequency distribution. The
frequency distribution tells us how many values of the data are present within each class interval,
while a cumulative frequency tells.us how many values of a data are less than or within each
class interval.

In the following table cumulative frequencies are found and interval of 0 frequency is added at
the top. Column of upper class boundary is also included which are necessary for construction of
cumulative frequency polygon or ogive.

Cumulative Frequency Polygon and Cumulative Frequency Curve
(Ogive) |
A frequency distribution can also be represented by a cumulative frequency polygon or Ogive.
An ogive and a cumulative frequency polygon are related but distinct concepts in statistics and
data visualization. |
_ Cumulative Frequency Polygon
A frequency polygon made by taking cumulative frequency on y axis is called cumulative
. frequency polygon. It is made to wisualize the cumulative distribution ofa variable,
To draw a cumulative frequency polygon, the class boundaries are plotted on x-axis and
cumulative frequencies on y-axis. The points are marked on the graph using the upper class
boundaries and the respective cumulative frequencies. These points are joined by straight line
segments and the polygon is completed by drawing a vertical line segment to join the last marked
point with x-axis. Following is a cumulative frequency polygon representing the data given
above. , ) {

Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive) i oy Jae jaa
A graph showing the cumulative frequency (or cumulative relative frequency) of a variate ;
as a curve, with the x-axis showing the values of the variable and the y-axis showing the
respective cumulative frequency is called Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive).
It is also known as a cumulative distribution function (CDF) |

_ | : Measures of Distribution
These measures are used to understand the spread and distribution of the data, and are often used
with measures of central tendency to get a better understanding of the dataset. They include:


--- Page 250 ---

i. Quartiles bo
The three values which divide the whole data into four equal parts are called quartiles. Quartiles
are usually denoted by Q: , Q2 and Q;. The lower quartile Q; divides the data in | : 3. The middle
quartile Q2 divides the data in 1 : 1. It is infect nothing different from median of data. The upper
quartile Qs divides the data in 3: 1.
Ql= ri th value of data & Q2= (= == )" value of data = median
When data is arranged in some order, it can be represented by a single value that lies exactly at
the centre of data. “The central or middle most value of an arranged data is called its median’,
Q3= = th value of data
The quartiles can also be estimated graphically from a cumulative frequency polygon.
e To estimate Q; (lower quartile), mark = on y-axis.
* Draw a line parallel to x-axis from that point to intersect cumulative frequency polygon.
e Drop a perpendicular from this point of intersection to x-axis. The value of data where the
perpendicular meets x-axis is lower quartile Qi.
Similarly, Q2 and Qs; can be estimated from cumulative frequency curve, by marking > and 2
on y-axis and following the same procedure used for Qi.
Example:
The scores on a test were compiled into a dataset with the following quartiles:
Ql= 40, Q2 or median = 70, Q3= 90
What percentage of students scored above 90 on the test?
Solution: From the quartiles it is obvious that one fourth (25 percent) of the students scored
above 90.

ii. Deciles a ; :
Deciles divide a dataset or a distribution into 10 equal parts, each representing 10% of the data.
By looking at the deciles, we can get a sense of the shape of the distribution, including where the
majority of the data points are concentrated and where the outliers are lying.

Ten Deciles of a dataset are described as follows: Pe!

D1: lowest 10% of the data Deciles are often used in statistics,
D2: lowest 20% of the data economics, and social sciences to
D3: lowest 30% of the data understand the distribution ofa ee

- variable, such as:‘income, wealth or

D10: highest decile under which100% of the data lies. ee .

Example; A company wants to analyze the salaries of its employees. The related department

compiles a dataset and calculates the deciles. The deciles are as follows:

Pct ave Sasa SN Bak Ft


--- Page 251 ---

DI = Rs.40,000 , D5 or median = Rs.60,000 ; D10 = Rs.80,000
What percentage of employees earn a salary above Rs.60,000 but below Rs.80,000? .
Solution: From the above data, percentage of employees earning salaries above 60,000 and
below Rs. 80,000 are between D5(median) and D10 i.e 90 % — 50% = 40 %
(Remember: D10 represents highest 10 % i.¢ Rs. 80,000 and D9 represents below Rs. 80,000)
lil. Percentiles | |
_ Percentiles divide a dataset or a distribution into 100 equal parts, each representing 1% of the
data. It's a way to understand the distribution of a dataset or a variable by looking at the
percentage of data points that are below a specific value.
Some common percentiles include: _ _
* 25th percentile (Q1): 25% of data points are below this value. | Maths Play Ground: |
* 30th percentile (Q2 or median): 50% of data is below Q2. | Help students to design quiz wheel
« 75th percentile (Q3): 75% of data points are below this value, or quiz maonine For the |
* 90th percentile: 90% of data points are below this value. one aca of teense of
e 99th percentile: 99% of data points are below this value | i ; : |
Eee - : Ik a A ia 4 i : _ a _ : - _ _ i __ | __ a | : |
’ Percentiles are often used to:
understand the distribution of a variable (e.g., income, scores, masses). :
identify outliers,
compare individual values to the overall distribution. :
set benchmarks (e.g., top 10 %).
evaluate performance (e.g., moving up or down. in percentiles).
Example: Uzair scored in the 75th percentile on a test: Find how much percentage of the
students scored below him and how much percentage of students scored above him.
Solution: From the above information it is clear that the student's score is higher than 75% of
the total students. It means that
e 75% of the students scored below him ,
* 25% scored above him
iv. Inter Quartile Range
IQR=Q3-QI_.
The IQR represents the range of values within which the middle 50% of the data points fall. In
otlier words, it's the spread of the data within the middle half of the distribution,
IQR can describe: , :
Spread: A small IQR indicates less scattered, while a large IQR indicates more scattered data.
Variability: The IQR is a more efficient measure of variability than the Range.
Outliers: The IQR can help identify outliers. (data points beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the
quartiles are considered outliers), . |
Comparison: IQR is useful for comparing the spread of different datasets.


--- Page 252 ---

Example = #— oo a
A teacher wants to analyze the test scores of her students. She compiles a dataset as: ,
first quartile Q1 = 60 and third quartile Q3 = 95
a) What is the Interquartile Range (IQR) of the test scores?
b) What percentage of students scored between 60 and 95 (inclusive)? |
Solution: — )
a} The Interquartile Range (IQR) of the test scores is given by the relation:
b) As Q3 — QI represents spread of the middle half of a data set so 50% of students scored
between 60 and 95 (inclusive)
Example: ;
The adjoining figure shows an ogive representing the distribution of time in minutes spent by 60
preachers of SEED to deliver single Seerah lecture. Find Q1, Q2, Q3 and inter quartile range.

. Zt. Bennie’ si Pit
at amt ae .
19 20 30f 40 50 60 70 80
Solution: Time spent |
To estimate the median time spent from ogive, we observe that 50 % (half of) preachers spent
less than or equal to the median time to deliver the lecture.
Median corresponds to the 5" decile and 50" percentile, i.e.
Median = Q2 = DS = P50 == x 60 = 30
From 30 on y-axis, draw a horizontal line to meet the curve and then draw a vertical line to mect
x-axis as in above figure. .
From the figure, we observe that median time to deliver a lecture is 43.5 minutes.
Lower quartile corresponds to 25th percentile i.e.
Q1 (the lower quartile) = P25 = one quarter (25% of) total frequency = : x 60= 15
From the curve, the lower quartile = 37 minutes.
Upper quartile corresponds to 75th percentile i.e.
Q3 (the upper quartile) = P75 = three quarters (75% of) total frequency = = x 60 =45
From the curve, the upper quartile = 50.5 minutes.
_ The inter Quartile Range = Q3 — QI = 50.5 — 37 = 13.5 .

The Box and Whisker Plot Correlation
Box-and-Whisker Plot (or simply box plot)
A box plot typically consists of the following components:
Box: A rectangular box that represents the interquartile range (IQR). The box is divided into two
parts by a vertical line, which represents the median (Q2) of the data.
Whiskers: Two horizontal lines that extend from the box to the minimum and maximum values
in the dataset, excluding outliers. The whiskers represent the range of the data.
Outliers: Data points that fall beyond 1.5 times the IQR from the quartiles are considered outliers
and are plotted individually.
Median: The vertical line inside the box represents the median (Q2) of the data.
Quartiles: The edges of box represent 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3).
Box plots are useful for comparing datasets, identifying outliers, visualizing distribution and
summarizing data
Example: The given box and whisker plot shows the prices of stationery items, Hashir
purchased yesterday. ~~
Q | Q
50 160 Q2=300 . 800 a
* <————<—_ 190R ———__»
a) What is the mediani price of an item?
b) what are the min & max prices of the items purchsed by Hashir?
c) What is IQR of the data? d) what “age of items is above Rs. 800?
Solution:
a) From the box plot, it is clearly seen that median price of an item is Rs. 300
b) From the box plot, it is observed that min price of any item is Rs. 50 & max price of |
any itemisRs. 1000
c) IQR=Q3-QI =800- 160 = 640
d) As items between Q3 and Q4 are 25 % so “age of items above Rs. 800(Q3) is 25%.
Box and Whisker Plot Correlation
The | box and whisker plot correlation means the patterns or relationships between the _
distributions of two or more variables, Box and whisker plot correlations include:
1. Positive correlation:
lf the boxes and whiskers of both variables tend to move in the same direction (e.g., both
increase or decrease together), it may indicate a positive correlation.
2. Negative correlation:
If the DOxeS and whiskers of both variables tend to move in opposite directions (e.g., one
dncreases while the other decreases), it may indicate a negative correlation, |


--- Page 256 ---

3. No correlation: pe?
If the boxes and whiskers of both variables appear unrelated or don't show a clear pattern, it may
indicate no correlation.
Box and whisker plots only provide a visual representation and don't quantify the
correlation. Hitt

Construction of Scatter Diagram, Lines of Best Fit and
Interpretation of Data
Construction of a scatter diagram consists of: ;
i. Plotting the data points on a coordinate plane.
il. Representing each data point by a mark (e.g., dot, circle, or square).
We solve an example to understand the concept.
_ Example: — Table below shows the masses and heights of 11 boys.

(b) From the graph, it is observed that there is a strong positive correlation between masses
and heights of boys. More height, more the mass of boys.
(c) Line of best fit is drawn having almost half the data points on either sides of it.
(d) From scatter diagram, the boy with height 150cm should have a mass of 39 kg app.
Interpretation of a Scatter Diagram -
Pattern; There are several types of patterns: .
* Positive correlation: As x increases, y also increases.
«® Negative correlation: As x increases, y decreases.
* Nocorrelation: No apparent relationship between x and y.

Strength: Observe the strength of the relationship. A stronger relationship means the points are
closer to a straight line.
Outliers: Identify data points that don't fit the pattern.
Drawing Lines of Best Fit
A line of best fit helps to predict the value of a variable y for a given x. It is a line that appears to
fit the pattern. It may or may not pass through any data points however almost equal number of
points should lie on either side of it. The line of best fit can be represented by

Measuring Correlation using Scatter Diagram strength of the relation
Measuring correlation using a scatter diagram involves analyzing the and the presence of
pattern and strength of the relationship between two variables. outliers when
It includes following steps: interpreting the results.
' Plot the data
Identify the pattern (Positive correlation, Negative correlation and No correlation)
Assess the strength (Strong correlation, Moderate correlation and Weak correlation)
Calculate the correlation coefficient r by:
e Identifying the data points (x, y) by coordinates of each point on the scatter plot.
e Finding the mean of the x-values (X) and the mean of the y-values (¥).
* Calculating the deviation from the mean for x (xi—) and y (yi — ¥).
e Multiplying the x-deviation by the y-deviation (xi — x)(yi — ¥).
e Adding up the multiplied deviations for all points.
« Dividing the sum of the products by the square root of the product of the sum of the
squared x-deviations and the sum of the squared y-deviations. i.e.
r= D{(xi-X)x(yi- 9} / VOI — O* x TOI - Y)4)
Where r is the correlation coefficient, ranging from —1 (perfect negative correlation) to | (perfect
positive correlation).
Interpret the results high r value i.e. close to 1 or — 1 means Strong correlation, Low r value
i.e. close to 0 means weak correlation & sign of r indicates the direction of the correlation i.e.
positive or negative.

Measures of Dispersion
The single value which can represent a data is known as average or measure of central tendency.
In grade 9, different types of averages e.g. mean, median and mode are studied.
Let us find the arithmetic mean of scores of five participants of a math quiz:
V (Bilal’s score)  =5,5,5,5,5 => port. 2 =5
irl a
W (Umer’s score) | =1,3,5, 8,8 => Por = = =5
X (Usman’s score) =2,4,5,6,8 a 2 =5
Y (Hassan’s score) =—10,0,10,12,13 => Fas? 2=5
Z (Abdullah’s score) =—15,—5, 10, 15,20 => Z= ef a 2 =5
We have seen that all of the above five data have same measure of central tendency (arithmetic
mean) but they vary in different ways. The values of above data are scattered away from their
average in different ways. It is a confusing situation because we are unable to compare the data
on the basis of their average. We can say that the average of a data is not more significant unless
the scatterings of values around the average are measured. ,
The techniques or formulas which are used to measure, how the values of a data are scattered
around its central value, are called measures of dispersion.
Types of Measures of Dispersion
(a) Range
Range is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of the data. 1.€.
R =xm—Xo, where xm= maximum value and x»= Minimum value
(b) Variance
Variance is the mean of squared deviation taken from mean.
Usually it is denoted by S?. The formula for variance of grouped data:

or S*= oT ( 7 )* (Direct formula)
(c) Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a positive square root of variance. It is denoted by S and given by
following formulae:

Example: Data shows scores of Huffaz in a Hifz Quran test:

units. It is also used as a criterion for consistent performance. The data having smaller
C.V is more consistent than the data having larger C.V. }

1. Calculate the arithmetic mean of each data set.
2. Calculate the standard deviation of each data set.
3. Compare the means which indicates a difference in the central tendency of the two data sets.

. Probability
Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a number between 0 and |
both inclusive that represents the chance of an event happening. Here are some key concepts in
probability:
Experiment: An action or process that can produce a set of outcomes.
Outcome: A specific result of an experiment.
Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
Event: A set of one or more outcomes of an experiment.
Probability of an Event: A number between 0 and 1 both inclusive that represents the likelihood
of an event.
Types of Probability
There are several.types of probability such as:
* Theoretical Probability
The number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
® Experimental Probability
sed on the results of repeated trials of an experiment.
* Conditional Probability
The probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
* Dependent Probability
The probability of two or more events occurring dependently on each other.
© Mutually Exclusive Probability
The probability of two or more events that cannot occur simultaneously.
* Joint Probability
The probability of two or more events occurring together.
Probability of Combined Events
The probability of combined events depends on whether the events are independent, dependent,
or mutually exclusive.
Probability of Independent Events
The probability of two or more independent events occurring is the product of their individual
_ probabilities.
ie. P(A and B) = P(A) =< P(B)
Probability of Dependent Events
The probability of two or more dependent events occurring is the product of their individual
probabilities, considering the conditional probability of each event.
ic, P(A and B)= P(A) x P(BJA)
Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events
The probability of two or more mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual
probabilities.


--- Page 268 ---

Le. P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B)
Conditional Probability
Probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred.
ie.  P(A/B) = P(A and B)/ P(B)
For example:
1. Probability of drawing two Kings (with replacement):
P(King) * P(King) = 1/13 « 1/13= 1/169 = 0,006 (or 0.6%)
Probability of drawing two Kings (without replacement):
P(King) x P(King) = 4/52 3/51 = 3/663 = 0.0045 (or 0.45%)
2. Probability of rolling two 6s: P(6) x P(6) = 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36
3. Probability of drawing a King and then a Queen:
P(King) * P(Queen | King) = (4/52) = (4/51) = 16/2652
Remember to consider the type of events and their relationships when calculating the probability
of combined events.
Probability of Combined Events using Sample Space Diagrams
A sample space diagram is a visual representation of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
It can be used to calculate the probability of combined events by identifying the favorable
outcomes and dividing them by the total number of possible outcomes.
To calculate the probability of combined events using a sample space diagram:
« Draw a sample space diagram showing all possible outcomes of the experiment.
« Identify the favorable outcomes that meet the conditions of the combined event.
« Count the number of favorable outcomes.
e Divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes in the
sample space.
Example:
What is the probability that both coin A and coin B land heads up if both coins are flipped
simultaneously?
Solution: a | = : Say
Favorable Outcomes: hH (both coins land heads up) i
Number of Favorable Outcomes: 1 | |
Total Number of Possible Outcomes: 4 | | | |
Probability: 1/4 or 0.25 | |
This means that the probability of both coins landing —_| | | | |
heads up is 1/4 or 25%. | | ane
Probability of Combined Events using Diagram
There are several types of sample space diagram, including:
Possibility Diagrams Tree Diagrams Venn Diagrams


--- Page 269 ---

By using an appropriate sample space diagram, we can easily visualize and calculate the
probability of combined events. This method is especially helpful while dealing with
complicated experiments and multiple events.
(a) Probability of Combined Events using Possibility Diagram
Possibility diagram is graphical representation of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
Example:
Raabi and Jerry are hoping on their play circles of four sectors each painted in red, green, yellow
and blue colours.
Find the probability that they will jump on:
(a) At the same colour (b) At the different colours
Solution: We can associate the ordered pair (x, y), where x represents hops of Raabi and y
represents hops of Jerry to show an outcome in the sample space. Here (blue, green): means
Raabi lands on blue while Jerry lands on green.
50 the sample space is:
S = {(red, red), (red, green), (red, yellow), (red, blue), (green, red), (green, green),
(green, yellow), (green, blue), (yellow, red), (yellow, green), (yellow, yellow), (yellow, blue),
(blue, red), (blue, green), (blue, yellow), (blue, blue)} |
Which seems complicated and time taking method of writing sample space for bigger problems.

(c) Probability of Combined Events using Venn Diagram
A Venn diagram is a pictorial representation of sets and their relationships, using overlapping
‘disjoint circles to represent the intersection of sets. It can be used to calculate the probability of
combined events by identifying the regions that represent the favorable outcomes and calculating
their probabilities.
Example:
Zainab randomly picks a book from a library shelf containing 50 books, as shown in fig:
Find probabilities:
(a) Itis grade7 book (b) _—‘It is an English book U
(c) Itis an English book of grade 7 [ee ~]
Solution: | Grade? PK Grades
(a) The probability of picking a grade 7 book: if \ |

(b) ‘The probability of picking an English book Ne ee 40
(given that it's a grade 7 book): a —
P(Englis book from grade 7 books) = 2/5
(c) To find the probability of picking a book that is both a grade 7 book and an English book,
multiply the above probabilities:
So, the probability of picking a book randomly from the 50 books that is a grade 7 English book
is 1/25 or 4%.

By using a Venn diagram, we can easily visualize and calculate the probability of combined
events. This method is especially helpful when dealing with multiple events and their
intersections.
~"~Probability Rules
Addition Rule
The probability of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities.
Multiplication Rule
The probability of two or more events occurring independently is the product of their individual
probabilities.
Complement Rule
The probability of an event not occurring is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring.
Addition Rule of Probability for Mutually Exclusive Events
The addition rule of probability states that the probability of two or more mutually exclusive
events occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities.
P(A or B)= P(A) + P(B), | where A and B are mutually exclusive events.
Applying addition rule of probability to problems of rolling even and odd number on a dice
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving even and odd
numbers rolled on a dice by treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events
Example: .
Hajrah rolled a fair cubical dice once. Find the probability of rolling an even or an odd number.
Solution:
On a fair cubical dice, there are 3 even numbers: 2, 4, 6 and 3 odd numbers: 1,3,5
Since the dice has 6 faces, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.
The probability of rolling an even number or an odd number is: "
P(Even) = 3/6 = 1/2 and P(Odd) = 3/6 = 1/2
Since the events are mutually exclusive (a roll can't be both even and odd), we can add the
probabilities:
P(Even or Odd) = P(Even) + P(Odd) = 1/2 + 1/2 =1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving left and right hand turns
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving taking left or right
turns, by treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events. |
Example:
Mr. Bilal can make either a left turn (L) or a right turn (R) at an intersection on his journey to
Tiri Mengal. The probabilities of making a left turn and a right turn are:
P(L) = 0.3 (30% ) & P(R) =0.7 (70%). Find the probability of making either a left or a right turn.
Solution: )
Since making a left turn and making a right tum are mutually exclusive events (he can't make


--- Page 272 ---

both at the same time), so
we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of making either a left turn or a right tum:
P(L or R) = P(L) + P(R) = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving tossing a coin
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving tossing a coin by
treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events. .
Example:
Sunayna tossed a fair coin with two outcomes: Heads (H) and Tails (T). The probabilities are:
P(H) = 0.5 (50% chance of getting Heads) and P(T)=0.5 (50% chance of getting Tails)
find the probability of getting either Head or Tail.
Solution:
Since getting Head and getting Tail are mutually exclusive events (the coin can't land on both at
the same time), so
we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of getting either Heads or Tails:
P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T) = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1
Applying addition rule of probability to problems involving winning or losing
The addition rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving winning or losing by
treating the outcomes as mutually exclusive events.
Example:
Affan played a game with two possible outcomes L and W such that P(W) = 0.4 (40%) and
P(L) = 0.6 (60%). Find the probability of either winning or losing the game.
Solution:
Since winning and losing are mutually exclusive events (he can't both win and lose at the same
time), we can apply the addition rule to find the probability of either winning or losing:
P(W or L) = P(W) + P(L)=0.4+0.6=1
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Independent and Dependent Events
The multiplication rule of probability states that the probability of two or more events occurring
is the product of their individual probabilities.
(i) For independent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
(ii) For dependent events:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(BIA); where P(BIA) is the conditional probability of B given A.
Example: (Independent Events)
Haneen flipped a fair coin twice. What is the probability of getting heads both times?
Solution:
P(Heads on first flip)='4 and P(Heads on second flip) = 1/2
Since the coin flips are independent, we can apply the multiplication rule:
.. P (Heads on both flips) = P(Heads on first flip) x P(Heads on second flip) = 1/2 x 1/2= 1/4
Example: (Dependent Events)
Zeemal drew 2 cards from a standard deck of cards. What is the probability of drawing two


--- Page 273 ---

spades in a row?
Solution:
P(First card is spade) = 13/52 = 1/4 .
P(Second card is spade | First card is spade) = 12/51 |
Since the events.are dependent, we can apply the multiplication rule with conditional probability
P(T wo spades in a row) = P(First card is spade) x P(Second card is spade | First card is spade)
= 1/4 x 12/51 = 3/51
Multiplication Rule of Probability Involving Trade
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving trade by
treating the outcomes as independent events.
Example:
Mahmil made 2 trades, as given:
Trade 1: Buying Mangoes (BM) and Trade 2: Selling Berries (SB)
With the probabilities:
Find the probabi'ity of both trades being successful. .
Solution:
Since the trades are independent (the outcome of one trade doesn't affect the other), we can apply
the multiplication rule to find the probability of both trades being successful:
P(BM and SB) = P(BM) * P(SB)= 0.6 x 0.7 = 0.42 Es
This means there is a 42% chance of both trades being successful. |
Multiplication Rule of Probability Involving Flipping a Coin :
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving flipping a coin
by treating the outcomes as independent events.
Example:
Azkaa flipped a biased coin twice with following outcomes:
Flip 1: Heads (H) or Tails (T) and _‘ Flip 2: Heads (H) or Tails (T)
With the probabilities:
P(H)=0.7 nad P(T)=0.3  -Find the probability of:
i.  ° Both heads ii. First head then tail
iii. First tail then head iv. Both tails
Solution: : ,
Since the coin flips are independent (the outcome of one flip doesn't affect the other), we can
apply the multiplication rule to find the probability of specific outcomes:
i, P(HH) = P(H) = P(H) = 0.7 x 0.7=0.49 (49% chance of getting Heads both times)
i," PQHT) = PH) = P(T) = 0.7 = 0,3 = 0.21 (21% chance of getting Heads then Tails)
iii, | P(TH)=P(T) x P(H) = 0.3 x 0.7=0.21 (21% chance of getting Tails then Heads)
iv. P(TT)=P(T)x P(T) =0.3 x 0.3 =0.09 (9 % chance of getting Tails both times)
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Drawing Cards with Replacement
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving drawing 2

ards with replacement by treating the outcomes as independent events.
{xample:
2omaisa draws 2 cards from standard deck with replacement as given :
‘irstdraw > Any card (52 possibilities)
second draw > Any card (52 possibilities, since the first card is replaced)
‘ind the probabilities of:
i. Both black cards ii. Both hearts
iii. | First spade then heart iv. First Queen of Spades then King of Hearts
solution: so
Since the events are independent (the outcome of the second draw does not depend on the first
jraw), we can apply the multiplication rule to find the probability of specific outcomes:
i. P(Both black cards) = P(black) x P(black) = 26/52 x 26/52 = 1/4
il. P(Both hearts) = P(heart) x P(heart) = 13/52 x 13/52 = 1/16
iii. | P(spade then heart) = P(spade) x P(heart) = 13/52 * 13/52 = 1/16
iv.  P(Queen of Spades then King of Hearts)
= P(Queen of Spades) x P(King of Hearts)
= 1/52 « 1/52 = 1/1704
Multiplication Rule of Probability for Drawing Cards without Replacement
The multiplication rule of probability can be applied to solve problems involving drawing 2
cards without replacement by treating the outcomes as dependent events.
Example:
Sundas draws 2 cards one after the-other from a standard pack of playing cards, such that:
First draw > Any card (52 possibilities) _
Seconddraw > Any card (51 possibilities, since one card has already been drawn)
then find the probabilities of: |
i. Both black cards ii. Both hearts
iii. | First spade then heart iv. First Queen of Spades then King of Hearts
Solution:
Since the events are dependent we can apply the multiplication rule to find the probability :
i. P(Both black cards) = P(black)  P(black/black) = 26/52°* 25/51 = 25/102
ii. P(Both hearts) = P(heart) x P(heart/heart) = 13/52 x12/31 = 3/51
iii. | P(spade then heart) + P(spade) x P(heart/spade) = 13/52 = 13/51 = 13/204
iv.  P(first Queen of Spades then King of Hearts)
= P(Queen of Spades) x P(King of Hearts/ Queen of Spades) = 1/52 x 1/51 = 1/ 2652

* A table consisting of values of a data along with their frequencies is.called a frequency table.

° In a group data, the table consisting of class intervals and their respective frequencies is called
frequency table or a frequency distribution.

' © The representation of data by a polygon in which class marks are plotted along x-axis and

frequencies along y-axis is called a frequency polygon.

° In a group data, number of values less than or within the limits of a class is called cumulative
frequency of the respective class.
