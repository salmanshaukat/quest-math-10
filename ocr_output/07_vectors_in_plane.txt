Introduction of Vectors
There are two main types of physical quantities used in Physics, Mathematics and
Engineering. They are known as, ‘scalers’ and ‘vectors’
Scalar |
A physical quantity that possesses magnitude only, is called a scalar quantity. It can be
completely specified by a number along with unit. For example, mass, time, speed, density,
work, distance, length, perimeter, area, volume, etc.
Vector :
A physical quantity that possesses both magnitude and direction, is called a vector quantity.
For example, weight, displacement, momentum, force, velocity, acceleration, electric field
etc.

terminal point with the arrow head denoted by AB.

Position Vector .
The vector used to specify the position of a point P with respect to ans Pp
origin O is called position vector of P. The tail of this vector is at Lf |
origin and head at the point P. Thus OP is the position vector of | Of
point P with respect to O. | /

=> AB=b-d
Rectangular or Cartesian Coordinate System
A rectangular or Cartesian coordinate system consists of -_
two number lines which are mutually perpendicular. B}--------¢ PG y)
Their point of intersection is called the origin, usually =A
denoted by the letter ‘O’. Horizontal line is called x-axis x = | 7
and vertical line is called y-axis. Ordered pairs of numbers o A ants
can be represented on a Cartesian plane, which is sometimes |
called the Coordinate plane or xy-plane. Each point in the
plane corresponds to an ordered pair (x, y) of real numbers + yraxis
x and y, called the coordinates of the point.
Cartesian plane has got this name after the French mathematici an Rene Descartes
(1596 — 1650). He developed the idea of the coordinate plane and the correspondence
 -of ordered pairs of numbers to’ points in the coordinate plane. Each point in the plane
can corresponds to only one ordered pair and vice versa.

Vector in a Plane
Let R be the set of real numbers, then the Cartesian plane is defined as:
R? = {(x, y): x, y ER} y-axis
Any point P(x, y) is uniquely determined by its coordinates +
x and y. For a given vector U in the plane, there exists a unique P(x, y)
point P(x, y) in the plane such that: | ui”
i= OP / i /
For the point P(x, y), a unique ordered pair [x, y] is used for [Fal ee
the vector i called position vector of P(x, y). Thus: (0,0) x-axis
Negative of a Vector .
A vector having the same magnitude but opposite in direction of a —
given vector b is called the negative of b and is denoted by —b. es |
If u = [x, y], then negative vector of i is defined as: —
Example:
P(3, — 4) is a point in the plane, Find the position vector OP and then its negative vector.
Solution:
Given is P(3, — 4) in the plane.
Position vector of P = OP = [3, —4] :
Negative vector of OP = —OP =- (3, -4] =[-3,4] "°
Zero or Null Vector
If the initial and terminal points of a vector coincide then the vector has zero length.
This vector is called zero vector and is denoted by 0. The zero vector has no direction. So, it
. can be assigned as convenient direction according to the situation. The zero vector is denoted
0 =[0, 0]

Unit Vector .
A vector which is in the direction ofa non-zero vector % and has magnitude | is called a unit
vector of # and is denoted by fi. If % is non-zero vector of arbitrary length |i| then:
fag > i=|te
This mean any vector i can be constructed by multiplying the magnitude of the vector to its
unit vector. The process of finding the unit vector of a vector ii is called normalizing the
vector i.
If ti = [x, y], then its unit vector is written as:
9 = ey K | x y |:
© hxt+y? ixt+y? ' fxt+y?
Example:
Find magnitude of the vector u = [-5, 12]. Also find unit vector of w.
Solution:  wu=(-5, 12]
Here, x = -5, y= 12 ;
Magnitude of u = |i] = fx? + y2=./(—5)* + (12)? = V25 + 144 = V¥169 = 13 units

Translation by Vector
Translation by a vector is‘a process that moves a point or figure in space by a given vector.
It is a type of transformation that slides a figure without rotating it, so the shape, size, and
orientation of the figure do not change. .
Geometrically :
Place the tail of the arrow at the point, and the translated point is at the head of the arrow.
Algebraically
Represent the points and the vector by their coordinates. The translation vector's coordinates
indicate how far to move the points along each coordinate axis. .
For example, the vector [a, b] moves points a units horizontally and b units vertically.
For example, a translation vector that moves a figure aT 4
4 units right and 2 units down can be represented | | i !
mathematically as [4, —2] , or graphically as shown in a] |
the adjoining figure. It doesn’t matter where the vector +——— = ———;
is positioned in the plane. In this figure, the vector starts | |
at (—2, 2) and ends at (2, 0). But the initial point and | | i > | [
terminal point of the vector is irrelevant. What matters 7 + K-94 2 4
is the length of the vector and the direction in which it | | | |
points, so all you have to look at is how many units the — <2} —__;—___.
vector moves in the y-direction and how many units the | ; | |
vector moves in the x-direction,
Example: : — — ,
Use the translation vector [2, —1] to find the new coordinates of triangle ABC when:
A=(-3, 2), B=(-1, 0) and C=(-2, -1)
Solution:

Parallel Vectors f
Two non-zero vectors ii and @ are said to be parallel if i = Av, il :
where A is a scalar. If A > 0 then both vectors have the same Fe
direction and if A < 0 then both are in the opposite direction. —_____»
The vectors which are in the opposite direction are known as anti-parallel vectors.
In component form, when i = [x1,-yi].and @ = [x2, y2] are parallel vectors, then:
=> [x, yi] = [Ax Ay2] => x1 =Ax2 and yi =Ay2
Example:
Prove that @ = [—12, —15] and b= (4, 5] are parallel vectors.
Solution: Given that @ = [-12, -15] and b = [4, 5] ,
a = [-12, -15] =-3[4, 5] =—3b
As d is scaler multiple of b, therefore di | B.
Equal Vectors |
Two vectors i and ¥ are said to be equal if both have the a .
same magnitude and direction. 3
If vectors if and @ are equal then we write Z = v. yo
If i = [x1, yi] and @ = [x2, y2], then i = @ implies that:
Ia yj=pa2y] = xx arid -yi = y2
e It is not necessary for the equal vectors to have the same position.
e Geometrically two vectors are equal if they are translation of one another.
© If in the relation d = Ab and A =1 then a = b.
© Equal vectors are also parallel.

: Addition of Vectors
Head to Tail Rule . _
To add non-zero vectors # and q join the tail of the second vector q with the head of the first
vector J. Now the-vector obtained by joining the tail of the first vector to the head of the
- second vector is the vector j + q called the resultant vector of p and q.
This method for the addition of two vectors is called head to tail rule of addition. Since p,q
and p + q are along the sides of a triangle XYZ, so this method of addition of vectors is also
known as triangle law of addition. a:
Parallelogram Law of Addition :
Consider any parallelogram PQRS. Let PQ = p and QR = q. 5 p R
. Since the vector QR has the same magnitude and direction as dy ‘a oe - oo |
that of PS. Similarly, SR has the same magnitude and y, fs ar a “g
direction as that PQ. Therefore: Pp B 4
PO = SR and QR =PS | }
Using triangle law of addition, we have:
PQ+QR=PR .
=> p+qG=PR
Showing that the diagonal vector PR of the parallelogram is the sum of the vectors of p and q.
This is known as parallelogram law of addition. Furthermore:
From APQR, PR=$+q (i) 2
From APSR, | PR =Gt+p (ii) For any vector d:
i B + q = G+ [from (i) and (ii)] = @+0=0+d=a

Polygon Law of Vector Addition
The process for the addition of vectors can be extended to any number of vectors. For
instance, let we have four vectors d, b,@,d_ and we need to find their sum.
From the figure,
OA=4d, AB= b, BC =¢, CD=d PD
Now d+ b+2+ d=O0A+AB+BC+CD / d
= (0A + AB)+BC+CD J we:
=0C+CD (+ 0B +BC =0C) | Zl
=OD *) a A
Here, OD is the sum of all these four vectors. The same method is adopted to find the sum of
any number of vectors, This method is called polygon law of addition of vectors.
Explanation: If ti = [x1, yi] and 0 = [x2, y2], W = [>3, ys], then:
i++ W = [xy yi] + [x2, y2] + bes, y3] = [er + x2 +23, yi + y2t ys]
Example:
if a =[4, 6] and b =[-3, 1], ¢= [2 ,-2) then find d + 2b + 2. Also find |@ + 2b + ¢l.
Solution:
Given that, @ = [4,6], b = [-3,1] and ¢ = [2,-2]
Now, d+ 2b +@=[4,6] + 2[-3,1] + [2,-2]=14,6] + [-6,2] + [2,-2]
|a + 2b + |= V0? + 6? = V36 = 6units
Subtraction of Two Vectors
To subtract a vector, form the other we find the negative vector of the vector to be subtracted
and then add it to the other vector.
Consider two non-zero vectors i and v then: | a ‘ je /

. ui—-t=iu+(—v). : Jf -(_-—v
From the figure, AB = i and BC = —@; then | /
AB+BC=AC (head to tail rule of addition) 3

i+ (8) =a-8 = AC \4 ——r"
Thus, AC is the vector which represents ti — B. i F \ oe | *
In component form, if = [x1, yi] and @ = [x2, y2}, then: rane
i — i =([m, yi] — [2, y2] C
= [x1 — x2, yi — y2]

Example:

Application to Geometry
There are many theorems and geometrical problems that can be solved by using vector
methods. oe
We solve some example here..
Example: 4
What type of a quadrilateral ABCD is if 2AB = DC? |


--- Page 156 ---

Solution: D c
2AB = DC implies that: \ /
2|AB| = |[DC| and AB {| DC \ /
These two conditions show that ABCD is a trapezium. B
Example:
A(x, y), B(-2, 3), C(—3, — 4) and D(4, —5) are vertices of a D c
parallelogram taken in order. Use vector method to find vertex A. / /
Position vectors of vertices of parallelogram are: / /
OA=xt+yj, OB=-21+3) .
OC=-3t-4j, OD=4t-Sj
= 0B — OA = (—2t + 3f) — (xt + yf) = (-2 -x)t+ 3 -y)j
DC = OC — OD = (-31 - 4) = (40 — 5f) = (-3 — 4) + (4 + 5)f=—78+j
As, ABCD is a parallelogram, therefore:
AB=DC => (-2-x)i+-—y)j=-7its
=> —2i-xi+3f-—yf=-7i+f => —2i+7i2+3j7—j =xi+yj ,
=> Si+2f =xi+yj => x=5,y=2
.. Fourth vertex of parallelogram is A(5, 2).
Example:
Use vectors to prove that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.
Solution: s R
Consider any rhombus PQRS. Let p, q,7 and S be the lig’ er |
position vectors of the vertices P, Q, R and S respectively. / \ “4
Let M and N be the mid points of diagonal vectors PR | A \ ' f
and QS respectively. L\
pv.ofM=2*F (i) p.v.ofN=2*5 (ii) P Q
Since PORS is a rhombus, therefore:
PG =SR Prove that the diagonals
=> q@-p=r-s of parallelogram, square
> G+s=ptr (iii) and rectangle bisect each
Using equation (iii) in (i) and (ii), we get: other.
p.v.of M = p.v.of N
Since the position vectors of the mid-points of both the diagonals are same.
Therefore, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.
